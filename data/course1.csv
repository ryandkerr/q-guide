African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 11: Introduction to African Studies,Really take time to read the assigned readings and participate in class discussions. This way you will learn a lot about the culture and history of different African nations and the continent as  a whole.,Be prepared to be opened to a whole new way of seeing Africa,This class is really fun. There are a wide range of readings which are interesting and the professor is a really engaging lecturer. I learnt a lot in class discussions and sections. The only drawback about the course is that there is not enough in-depth engagement with topics so it could seem really surface at times and I think this is because the course is trying to cover so much in so little time.,"This may not be an appropriate course for those who are not motivated enough to pursue a bit of independent study. I learned a lot in this course because I really took the time to research for my final paper. If a student is not willing to do the same, it could be very easy to come out of this course without learning a whole lot.","It's a great class that has some really cool and interesting lectures.  But, make sure you do all of the readings because you will be tested on them.  Besides, they are actually really interesting!","If you want to learn about Africa and need a fairly easy gen ed Soc World credit then take this course. However, if taking a Gen Ed is the only thing driving you, then this is not the course to take as the readings make the class worth it and are hard to attempt even if you have interest in the material.",A good course! Each week is  different topic relating to Africa which is interesting.  Both the final and the midterm are take home papers which works well for a lot of schedules.,Wonder course. Come with an open mind.,"It is a great class but be wary because it seems to focus so much on west africa. so it might not give you a holistic overview of AFrica. However, the professor is passionate about the class and he is fun to listen to.",Prepared to have fun while you learn! And bring an open mind!,You will get the most out of the course if you do the readings,"Lectures are very boring and didn't learn anything in them, but are only once a week. There is no work for this class except 2 short midterm papers and a final paper on anything in Africa.",Great class if you are interested and dedicate yourself. You will get what you need out of it,The TFs in this course are amazing and give great perspective into African studies.  I thoroughly enjoyed our discussions in sections.,Its a great class. You learn a lot about Africa and African issues in general and you get a chance to have meaningful debate with people who are interested in the same topic.,It is a really cool course if you want to have some introduction to Africa from a very knowledgable source.,Deji is amazing.,"If you need to round out a difficult fall semester, take this.  Especially if you have orgo or something else that's notoriously difficult.",The course content is pretty interesting if you have any interest in African affairs at all. The workload is also very manageable.,its solid. more interesting for those taking it for concentration and secondary requirements,"This course is a mixed bag. Cons: Lectures are often dry, hard to follow, and don't tie in enough to readings. Readings are often boring, and hard to follow. Pros: Exceptional teaching staff who care about you and about the material, are very helpful and knowledgable. Sometimes readings are very fascinating. Class is very easy because not much is required. However, if you do do the readings and pay attention in lecture you will learn much more (obviously). Deji and Kimberley (TFs) are both fantastic, and to get the most out of the class you should spend as much time with them. The reason I took the class is because the shopping week class was conducted by Deji. Professor Olupona is not bad, and clearly cares about the material, but I'm not sure if he's the best fit for an introductory class. I do appreciate how he works to make lecture more of a dialogue. I often felt lost in class because I came in with very little knowledge of African history, readings were often too theoretical, and lecture didn't always seem to relate. That being said, very little is required, good way to do C&B, and you'll get to work with amazing TFs.",Interesting and perfect work balance,"This class is really chill, and you learn a lot. Don't do all the readings, but if you pay attention in class, it will be a great learning experience with no stress!","Very little work until midterm, final, and in class presentation.  Difficult to understand the professor, but overall interesting.  Easy gen-ed if looking for a gem class with little work.","Professor Olupona is incredibly fascinating when he talks about African religions or Yoruba traditions, but otherwise seemed unequipped to teach the rest of this course. Lectures were given in broad generalities, with a clear ideological bent and remarkably little factual information. If you are coming into the course with zero knowledge about Africa, then maybe consider taking it. But if you have a bit of background knowledge, I'd suggest avoiding it. The discussions in lecture are particularly excruciating - most people haven't done the readings (which are generally unexciting), and the way to 'win' those discussions is to say that we need to move beyond the western perspective, without explaining what that means. The best thing about this course is the TF Ayodeji, who was enthusiastic and incredibly knowledgeable, and often had to clarify Professor Olupona's arguments in section. There are better courses on Africa out there, and I would recommend those instead.",Very solid survey and very nice teaching staff! Reasonable workload,This is an interesting class that fulfills a general education requirement with not that much work.,"It is very easy, but do all the readings","As a whole, I did enjoy this class.  The lectures are not as structured as I would have liked, but the topics are still very interesting.  I knew very little about Africa answering the class, and I ended the semester feeling as though I understood many of the continent's complexities.  What made this class great was the teaching staff.  The two TFs were absolutely amazing.  My specific TF was Kimberly and she is the single best TF I have had at Harvard.  She made section engaging and was able to make everyone participate without section being intimidating.  She made sure we learned a lot about present-day Africa.  As a whole, the class is pretty easy, but you will learn a lot.  The papers give you a ton of freedom, and allow you to explore any topic you are interested in.","Finally, a satisfying thing to take as a gen ed! If you are looking either for some basic knowledge of Africa due to having a White Guy Centric history education or are looking for a fun way to fill your Societies of the World, this is a GREAT class for you. Workload is **extremely** manageable, teaching staff is enthusiastic, and brings out great new perspectives for everyone involved in discussions. The one flaw is that if you are interested in specifics of African countries this is probably not the class for you (colonial and postcolonial history are discussed well though)",This is fun and relatively laid back. I highly recommend it if you're interested in learning about Africa as a whole or specific parts.,very easy,"I really enjoyed this class! Professor Olupona is a great lecturer and the whole subject of African studies is very interesting. Deji is the best TF!!! You'll have great discussions in section and good laughs too! He's very understanding if you need extensions on deadlines, just communicate with him. Also, if you don't have time to read everything, just learn how to skim well if you want to contribute to discussions. Seriously, take this class!!!"
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 16: Sociology of the Black Community,"Great course, covers a lot of material. Quite a lot of work (nearly a book a week, weekly reaction papers, long take-home mid-term and final exams) but it pays off!","Didn't live up to the hype, but definitely informative if you're interested in the black-white inequity of America","This was the best class I have taken at Harvard. It covered many important topics pertaining to the black community, and Professor Bobo is a great lecturer and discussion facilitator. Stay on top of reading and the midterm and final paper won't be too bad. Take this class!!","Don't be fooled by it being ""22""- this class is pretty demanding. Lots of reading (a book+ each week). Response papers are graded pretty harshly. Demanding mid-term and final take-home exams (which are really just long papers). However, if you are willing to put the time in this course is totally worth it!",Great class and great discussion!,"This class teaches you a lot about the black experience in America today, and I wouldn't necessarily say that there is a particular agenda that Professor Bobo has.  Come in with an open mind and don't be afraid to butt heads with your peers.  I wish I did more of that, to be honest.","This course is awesome! I really enjoyed the environment and learned so much that is relevant to society today. Just know that the midterm and final are significant lengths (10-15 & 20 pages respectively), but doable. I loved it!",Take notes throughout the readings to make writing the papers easier.,This class is really wonderful and the readings are extremely insightful and interesting.  This class was an eye-opnening experience and I am really glad I took it.  Make sure you pace the readings out and don't fall behind on them!,Prepare to be engaged with Professor Bobo and to read a lot of material.,You will learn much.,This class is really interesting and engaging.  Being able to discuss the aspects of the black community was extremely enlightening.,It requires a serious time commitment but it rewarding to say the least,This class taught me to think and develop sociological arguments in historical and modern contexts. It led me to deeply consider the black American experience and what changes need to occur to educate the public and create solutions for the racial inequality in our country.,- Schedule out how you will do the reading. The reading in the course is really good actually but I never got to finish most of the books.,"Take this class!!! In a small setting, you learn sociological explanations for issues of racial inequality that are central to modern society. No class has sparked more out-of-class discussions than Sociology of the Black Community--not just with classmates but also with roommates, people you're eating dinner with, and random students who ask what classes you're taking. The syllabus follows a clear structure and includes really interesting reading materials. Also Bobo's lectures pair well with the readings.","This is in general a great course but my only caveat would be come ready for discussion, it wasn't billed as a discussion course but it is and is driven by the discussion the group has, so if you have a great group of people you'll have an amazing course experience, if not then probably not"
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 20: Introduction to African Languages and Cultures,Completely changed my perspective on African culture.  Truly a great class.  Professor Mugane is a genius and Lowell was a great TF. Social engagement project is also a lot of fun.,"Prof. Mugane's lectures are very engaging, and Lowell as a TF engages with the material and the students very well. I really enjoyed the readings and the types of questions we were asked to consider in the course. It felt important and relevant.","Really cool class. Would especially recommend as a first introduction to African studies. You don't really consider how important the language question is before taking it, and it's fantastic at blowing up former false preconceptions. Readings in the second half of the course are definitely less interesting but the middle portion of the class in particular is fascinating","If you're curious about the African continent, like languages, or are fascinated about other cultures, definitely take this class.",Really cool course and Mugane and Lowell are both really awesome instructors,great course that deals directly with the language question! Lowell is simply the best TF,TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Definitely take it! Prof. Mugane is a great guy and is very knowledgeable, as is the TF Lowell Brower. The workload isn't too intense and the discussions are amazing.","If you stay on top of the subject matter and coursework, this class will be one of the most rewarding yet.","Take the class. It will pay off dividends, especially if this doesn't seem like a class that you previously thought you would ever take."

Push him to focus on grammar and writing  if that is something you struggle with.","Learn Haitian Kreyol! Very useful in Boston, even if you never go to Haiti.","This is truly a remarkable (and easy) class. You really learn Haitian Creole quite quickly, but keeping up isn't ever a problem. Lesly is an amazing teacher who emphasizes listening and speaking from the very beginning, correcting mistakes over the course of the class in both a lenient and encouraging manner. This is a HUGE help to learning the language. The class is a bit disorganized and assignments are sometimes late to come, but this isn't usually a major source of stress. I recommend taking it if you want to have a fun, laid-back class for your schedule and if you really want to learn a language well!"
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 90r.i: Igbo,It is a great class environment with very few students in your class and an authentic Igbo teacher who lives the culture.,"The course is a very good way to become immersed in a culture removed from the Harvard bubble which so often traps us in a specific, closed way of thinking.","If you want to learn about a very interesting culture of Africa, this is the way to go.",Good course!,"Class works great for an elective or a language, Professor Onaga is great."
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 90r.j: Kinyarwanda,"This was my seventh semester of Kinyarwanda. The language is very difficult, but fascinating and beautiful. Dr. Bayingana is a wonderful, dedicated man, and there cannot be many other people in the world more qualified to teach Kinyarwanda at a university level. There's a reason I'm still here after so long.",Bayingana is a wonderful and dedicated instructor and I would recommend his Kinyarwanda courses to anyone!,Dr. Bayingana is one of the best language instructors you can ask for. He has enthusiasm for teaching and he really makes sure that students benefit from the class.

Ntuli is an amazing instructor, and you'll really be surprised by how much you end up learning by the end of the semester. Great intro to Zulu.",It is a great class and the instructor is very passionate about the class.,its a great environment to learn an awesome language,"Really cool professor that is a pleasure to know. Sometimes class can be confusing, but between other students and just asking what she meant after class everything can be resolved.",This class is fun and interactive.,"Very fun class, can be confusing at times but that can be expected with any language. highly recommend if trying to fill language requirement."

Otherwise, it can be a bit boring. The work isn't terribly hard, though the grading can be.",Do the reading and participate in lecture.,"This course is an excellent way to begin interacting with anti-Apartheid literature, and serves as an excellent grounding to begin discussion of the nature of race relations in two societies fraught with tension. Loved Prof BJ's lectures!"
African and African American Studies,"AFRAMER 117x: Of Mean Streets and Jungle Fevers: Race, Gender and Ethnicity in Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee","Go to class to watch the films. You don't have to but I found it easier to actually go to class and watch the films than watch them in my own time. Very low key class. One short paper for the midterm, and another slightly longer paper for the final. Do the reading because they are interesting. You don't need to though. I enjoyed the class",Only take it if you're self-motivated in topics.,Take it. Great films - no work. You learn a lot by hardly doing anything.,Enjoy the films and really wrestle with the questions that they raise.,Prof BJ is the man... and so is TF Ernie! Good class. Chill watch 2 movies then have a lecture on them. The readings were really interesting although i'm not sure how many people did them. Section with Ernie was amazing.,Excellent class. Light workload and the professor and TF's were great.,"Very interesting course that forces you to sit back and think critically about two filmmakers you would think have nothing in common. That being said, you take out what you put in with this course. You can just coast, but if you actually pay attention to what Professor Jeyifo is saying, you will realize he is actually proposing a series of very articulate and very deep assertions about the films we studied. And in that light, I highly recommend this course.","Very easy class, requires very little time. Movies are very interesting and papers are short and easy.",Great course to get an inside view into two of the most prolific directors the movie industry has ever produced.,"This is an amazing class for those who love film. If you've always wanted to watch Scorsese or Lee, this is a great opportunity to view some of their best work. Also there is very little work (only two papers) and you get to watch great movies in class. The lecture can be a bit dry but it can still be extremely helpful for your papers.","It's a great introduction to the films of Scorsese and Lee. If you are interested in developing or even just learning about film analysis, take this course! It's painless and applicable to real life.",the films are great and it will change the way that you look at films in the future,"The movies are great, but the staff is somewhat unorganized, yet they will hypocritically expect you to take the course very seriously. Regardless, not a ton of work and it provides a great excuse to watch the work of Lee and Scorsese.","Many students take this course because they've heard it's very easy and unfortunately don't get much out of it. Don't be that student. Well at least the latter part. Of course many students do need a lighter course to balance their schedules. But don't be the student to not get anything out of this course. It really is fascinating stuff! Not just the films themselves, but what the filmmakers (Lee and Scorsese) are saying to their audience. The analytical skills I've learned in this course have not only allowed me to watch movies in a whole new light, but think about life differently. The movies in this course were unique because the directors were doing innovative things for their eras, but because even today movies are not trying to portray messages about race, gender, class and so many other issues in America. With that being said, you definitely can bullshit this course if you choose to. But you can also choose to engage with the knowledge and analytical skills being given to you and get a lot out of it.",Great film selection; professor Jeyifo is incredibly knowledgable and you're guaranteed to learn something new each lecture; will get out what you put in.,A must take for fans of either cinema or these two filmmakers.,"It's an awesome class, the movies are great and the TFs do a great job of discussing them.","lectures were hard to understand. Section could be interesting sometimes, but often felt forced.","Courseload is extremely light. Class meets only once a week, and every 2 out of 3 classes are film screenings. The third is a lecture/discussion on the films. There are only 2 papers for the entire course. One midterm paper, and one final paper.","Best course I've had on film. Hadn't seen a Spike Lee film before, and I left the class loving him. Reading is unnecessary because we never really even discuss it. If this stays a two essay class (no midterm or final) then everyone should take this. It's easy and you come away with a better understanding of two master filmmakers.",This class in super easy. It's a great class to balance with a hard schedule.,"Take the course! If you get Warrick as a TF be prepared to spend an hour every week just wondering where your life went wrong though this man is a time waster. Does not use section effectively in the slightest, which isn't too bad in a class like this where a lot of reflection from you is necessary (so it's not like a math course or something when if the section isn't teaching you you're done for) but it'd be nice to have meaningful discussion in section every now and then. It was too much for Warrick to handle though. He also consistently let us out late.",Definitely take the course. It was the best film class I've taken at Harvard,"This a great course with a fairly easy workload. Professor Jeyifo is not a great lecturer, but his handouts are useful. Plus, you literally get to watch Scorsese and Spike Lee movies every week, which is super dope. The two essays are pretty easy as well.",Great class. Great movies.,"Excellent material, great professor, and manageable workload. it doesn't get much better than this.",Incredibly relaxed class but frustratingly disorganized,It's a great low-stress class that will actually teach you something.
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 118: The History of African Americans From the Slave Trade to the Civil War,"This class is great if you know what you're getting yourself into. Vince is a lot of fun, really creative, and really cool, but he also can be tough to engage because of how smart he is. The material is challenging and disturbing, so while the grading might not be that tough, you will be challenged intellectually and personally. In other words, don't just take it on a whim. Take it if you know you're interested in the material.",This is the perfect class if you have no background in African American studies. It's essential history taught in a thoughtful way.,"Take it because it is only going to get better and it is already great. Professor Brown is a fantastic professor and really cares about the material. Not that difficult a class, but engaging and challenging material conceptually.",Do the reading--it is worth it. We read seminal works that are important if you want to be a scholar of this area of history,"This class will ground you very firmly in the historiography of the African American experience before the Civil War, with lectures serving as the primary basis for historical knowledge. Though his scripted lectures may seem rather dense, Professor Brown's patient, comical, and very attentive moderation of discussions makes every student's contribution valuable and worthy of further examination. The number and nature of the assignments seem fair and straightforward, although it seeks to synthesize a great number of sources for argumentative purposes. So make sure to do all the readings because it will be very important when it comes to writing the essays.","This class is such a gem. Professor Brown is incredibly brilliant, and my one complaint is that he doesn't speak for the entirety of the class.","Professor Brown is an amazing lecturer, and the material is extremely engaging. Take the class.","do not miss this chance to take a class with professor Brown. He is incredibly inspiring, insightful, imaginative and both his lectures and his discussion-facilitation are awesome. they have a couple kinks to work out since it was his first year teaching it (such as defining the papers more specifically), but I would highly highly recommend this class.",Great class. Great professor and TF's. There is a fairly heavy amount of reading but the readings were very interesting and I wanted to do the reading each week so it didn't really seem like I was doing that much work at all because I enjoyed it.
African and African American Studies,"AFRAMER 130x: Richard Wright: Literature, Philosophy, and Politics","Not only is Wright an amazing writer, but this class really allows you to understand Wright's philosophy and writing style by exposing you to his entire collection of work. Not many other courses at Harvard provide the opportunity to delve so deeply into a single artist's work. After taking this class, you will have a notion of Wright unlike many other readers, acclaimed critics included, who have only encountered some of his creations. That being said, you will be reading at least one piece by Wright every single week, which can get intense, given Wright's strong political opinions and complex thought processes. The professors are also really great. Take advantage!",Another great Af-Am class that looks in-depth at one author. Giving great insight into that persons works and influence
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 131: African American Literature from the Beginnings to the Harlem Renaissance
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 141x: Prejudice and Racism in Modern Society,"This class has the potential to be really interesting because of the subject matter but it did not work. It was no structure in the class. The professor while brilliant independently, did not help in this. He treated the class like grad students even though there were only 2 grad students in the class. The final 30 page paper was killer and we also had little instruction from the professor.",TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The readings and discussions will push you to think about prejudice and racism in ways you probably would not have.,"If you're very into the psychology of intergroup relations, take this course. If not, I'd suggest looking for something else. Professor Sidanius is super smart but doesn't give feedback at all throughout the semester, so be prepared to not know how you're doing grade-wise. The final paper can be a cool experience to explore a topic of your own interest though (although there's no prompt/guidelines, so it could also be stressful)."
African and African American Studies,"AFRAMER 178: Health, Society, and Subjectivity in the American Context",The class allows for some really interesting discussions and allows you the opportunity to think through a lot of very important issues,"This class was excellent. The material and subject matter were not only interesting but extremely relevant. The class discussions were engaging and thought provoking, moving far beyond the surface or traditional rhetoric. I actually felt like all of the work and assignments had a purpose and made me engage with the material in a productive way.",This is a great course you being to think critically about topics and issues that you would've never examined in the same eye before taking the class. Professor Ralph and Nick are amazing.,"This course was an excellent review of major issues in medical anthropology, working through an extensive array of personal narratives of suffering dealing with the stigma & experience of race, gender, socioeconomic class, disability, structural violence, immigration, and illness. Professsor Ralph is encouraging and intelligent and creates a supportive & inclusive environment: each student is expected to give a demonstration on a set of readings throughout the course and my class was filled with the most badass socially conscious ladies around (and one gentleman.) I would highly recommend this class. You'll learn a bunch of awful things about the United States and the world in general, but you won't leave without some hope for the future. Also, Professor Ralph is really cool.","This course was really, really great! It's one of those courses that everyone at Harvard should take before they graduate. The work load wasn't bad (a couple of papers, and weekly reflections), but it was one of the most thought provoking and worthwhile classes I have taken here at Harvard. I'm a pre-med, and though we talk about health, it's very much from a perspective of the people that are often marginalized in the health care system due to structural barriers both within and outside this system. Such a great class - take it!",I loved this class. Professor Ralph really goes out of his way to engage students. The workload is manageable-- you won't dread doing the work for this class and every weekly reading is less than 50 pages and is highly relevant.,I'm extremely glad you're taking this class; it was life changing.,This class is easy if you put the time in and participate in every lecture and section.,"It's a great class and will help you think critically about race, health,suffering, subjectivity and the production of knowledge.",This class is great!,It really gets you to think about narratives of pain and suffering in ways that are so necessary
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 188x: Contemporary Art in Africa : Proseminar,"Professor Blier was the highlight of the course. Regardless of whether or not the class ended up discussing the week's readings, her comments on a variety of issues and the wealth of her experience were incredibly valuable. She also provided solid feedback on weekly assignments as well as the final paper. The class seemed disjointed at times, but this often led to equally interesting discussions regarding topics that fell outside the syllabus."
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 209a: Africa Rising? New African Economies/Cultures and Their Global Implications,Taking a course with Jean and John Comaroff is a magical experience.  They are brilliant and incredibly invested in students' thoughts.,"Its light on reading, you must consider this if you are not into reading a lot of stuff","Great class. Not what the title implies, but you will learn a ton.",Carpe Diem!,"TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn so much from this class, without putting in tons of work. Just come having read (it's a reasonable amount) and prepared to learn and share, really incredible course.","I loved this course, and the Comaroffs are clearly very passionate about the material they teach! It's a very cool way to learn about new research that's happening in the field, and get to interact with professionals who are writing and doing this work!",You will learn a ton from the Comaroffs. They are absolutely brilliant and supportive professors and it has been a privilege to take a course with them!,"Take the course if you have not taken a course with the Comaroff's yet. They are some of the best professors Harvard has. However, the readings are not always that great and the discussion component of the course is dependent on who is taking the course. Take it for the professor's. The content needs to be worked on.",The Professors are amazing and the material is fascinating,"This is a great class to take if you're interested in African Studies regardless of your disciplinary bend since papers ranged from anthro, to history, to lit, econ, urban studies etc. 
Its also great if you're interested in seeing how a paper gets workshopped in an academic context. Not only were the contributions from both noon and evening sessions immensely interesting, it was also great to see the author in person discuss what their process and intention was as they wrote.
Added to all that, its very manageable workload. Definitely recommend!"
African and African American Studies,AFRAMER 301: Graduate Proseminar
African and African American Studies,SWAHILI A: Elementary Swahili,"Great, low-intensity language. Professor Mugane is an awesome teacher.","If you have no experience with African languages and will never take another, try Swahili. It's not that hard, and Prof. Mugane is a lot of fun. If you have any knowledge of another Bantu language, this course will be really slow and easy for you--but it will still be fun. Ask the course staff to push you and challenge you: I did, and it paid off.","This Swahili class is a pretty fun (and relatively low-stress) way of learning a language! Professor Mugane is very fun to learn Swahili from- he's hilarious, but I think what really made the class great was the TF, Sarah. Professor Mugane can sometimes be unclear in lecture, but Sarah cleared up these confusions and put in so much extra effort to make sure that we understood all the concepts. She's the most hard-working TF I've ever had at Harvard! She and Professor Mugane meet often to talk about the class, and it's very clear that they both really care about the student's learning. If there's something that most of the class doesn't understand, then Sarah and Professor Mugane put the blame on themselves and then work to make sure that we understand it. I'm not sure if Sarah will be TF'ing again next fall semester- in the spring '15 semester, she's actually going to be TF'ing a different course.",learn your vocab,This is a really fun course that is extremely relaxed. You also learn A LOT which is a nice plus!,Mugane is the man. He knows what he's doing and provides a fun and stimulating learning environment.,"The teaching staff is wonderful and makes you really want to learn the language. The homework and exams are directly correlated with what is going on in class, meaning no surprises. It's a great class!","Swahili A with Mugane is really fun, a chill class, and a good way to familiarize yourself with East African languages. The class has very little structure - Mugane will just kinda talk and say some words in Swahili before you understand what he is actually trying to teach, but overall, the lessons are great. He also tries to teach a bit about East African/Bantu culture, which is great.","It's a very fun language to learn, good for getting the language requirement out of the way."
African and African American Studies,SWAHILI B: Intermediate Swahili,"There are no other options if you want to study intermediate Swahili, but the course has so few in-class hours (2/week) and little homework so I did not end up learning that much. If you want to learn more I would recommend organizing a Swahili language table and doing independent studying along with the class.",It's a great way to learn Swahili

It's not inordinately stressful, and it's not going to pile up your workload if you're already taking very heavy classes. Definitely go for it.",Take this class!,It is a great course. It is thought very well and at a pace that can be understood by all the students.
African and African American Studies,YORUBA A: Elementary Yoruba,This class is a non-taxing class that will require minimal work and still teach you a great deal about the language.,Did not learn as much as I would have hoped because the class was very easy and we did not work enough to practice language in and outside of class in a way that developed our vocabulary.,"If you simply do the assignments, you will fall behind. You need to always pay attention in class.","take it, it's lovely."

Anthropology,ANTHRO 98xa: Junior Tutorial in Archaeology
Anthropology,ANTHRO 98za: Junior Tutorial in Social Anthropology,"This class is really enjoyable and also super helpful in teaching you what anthropology is and also how to design and carry out research. The atmosphere is also really relaxed so you don't feel stressed but you still learn a lot. I also really liked that the class balanced very well giving us enough independence to pursue ideas that interested us while also providing a lot of support and supervision as we developed our research projects. Even if you are not writing a senior thesis, this class would be super useful in helping you decide if you are on the fence but also is really useful in helping you build up your reading and writing skills. If you are writing a senior thesis, it is wonderful because it gives you a headstart by over a year over a lot of other fields which is really nice.","The concepts covered in this class are amazing, but just be ready for busy work.",This class is an excellent class to start building your thesis topic.,"Just be aware that if your version of this course is anything like the version I took, this will be an extremely time-consuming course with very high expectations for the amount of reading and writing students will do.  If possible, I would highly recommend scheduling some easier courses when you take this course; I think even if I were only taking this course and had no extracurriculars, I would still have a difficult time completely finishing all of the work that was asked of me.","As a space where you can give and receive feedback without hesitation from your classmates, this tutorial has proved to be amazing. You will find that everyone has crazy awesome ideas and plans for their research and I found myself looking forward to hearing everyone's progress. However, as a class with weekly writing assignments and biweekly one-on-one feedback sessions with the TF, this has been one huge disappointment. I came into this class with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for my potential thesis topic but I left with a feeling of tedium and exhaustion from the repetitive assignments and impractical advice on my research topic. I think I learned more from being around my classmates and discussing our topics than actually speaking with the TF despite the mandatory biweekly meetings which weren't even all that useful.","Pick your topic early (you sort of have to). The class has two final paper options: 20 page senior thesis proposal or an ethnographic research paper, but the class is more geared towards the first option (maybe they will change it in subsequent iterations of the class). For the final paper, know the theories you will use. The theoretical underpinnings behind your own topic are not discussed in depth throughout the course, but towards the end and in your final paper, they are essential.",Emrah is an INCREDIBLE tutorial leader. Also really use this course as an opportunity to do some deep thinking and planning about your thesis research.,"Read a book a week, and figure out what ethnography means early on.","It gives you introduction to work in anthropology and, if you want, thesis preparation. My friends from other departments were surprised to hear how meticulous and thoughtful the preparation is - and jealous, too. The more ideas and other courses in anthropology, the better you would be able to take out of the course.","This class is great to truly delve into the process of developing an anthropology research question, reading the relevant literature, and discussing with other students.  By the end I felt more prepared to take on a thesis project.  The best part is hearing what other students are interested in and working on (and to be honest, it's probably one of the best parts about anthropology--the diverse and cool interests of other students).  Ramyar is also a great tutorial leader who will guide you and keep you on track.","It all geared to making you write a thesis, whether you want to or not.",This class is an excellent opportunity to learn about how to create a research project through extensive writing assignments as well as interesting conversations with knowledgeable graduate students and peers.
Anthropology,ANTHRO 99z: Thesis Tutorial in Social Anthropology - Senior Year
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1010: The Fundamentals of Archaeological Methods & Reasoning,If you are at all interested in archeology take this class. Great introduction to archeology and I would especially encourage it to freshman or sophomores who could change concentrations. I took it as a senior fall and I loved it. Really gives you a great look at how archeology is done and is a great introduction to the discipline,"This is a great class! The professors give very interesting lectures. I did not know anything about archaeology before taking the class, but now I am eager to learn more. Sections are equally amazing! Each section is basically a field trip. My favorite sections were the stone tool making and the pottery making. My only warning is that this class requires a lot of reading. The readings are all fairly interesting but some of them were extremely long.","This class is really just an overview of a huge and broad subject, which can be both good and bad.","This class is a truly amazing experience! The material is interesting and engaging and the sections are fabulous! The opportunities that you will have are like something out of a novel.  I never imagined when I came to school in the fall that I would be holding a 1.6 million year old hand axe made by an ancestral human species.  This class is definitely an opportunity that you won't get at many other schools, so don't pass it up! It is not difficult to succeed as long as you keep up with the readings and do the section assignments.  Although there is a fair amount of reading, the topics are always quite interesting, so you will always be fully engaged.","If you very much don't want to do anything math-related in your undergraduate career this is an easy if not irrelevant way to fulfill an EMR requirement. Also, if you think you're interested in anthro but not really sure, this is a decent way to gauge it. (For me, both of these things left me a bit wanting, but that's just because of a change of interests midway through the semester).",This class is an easy class to get through if you show up to lecture/section.  It is only demanding if you don't pay attention.,"You might think taking Anthro 1010 is just a way to fulfill a Gen Ed or that archaeology isn't a worthwhile subject, but it's actually very interesting and I'm really glad I took the class.","This class is a great way to fulfill a GEN-ED, with some interesting sections and a few interesting lectures. It's also an easy class. If you'll feel bad about throwing away a real math class in favor of an exploration into the world of archaeology, don't take it. If you are looking for a guys-in-hats-in-the-desert party, take ANTHRO 1010.","This class is a great intro into archaeology and a great way to get the EMR Gen Ed out of the way with NO math whatsoever. The sections are really fun and hands on, you'll be doing something new each week which I always really looked forward to. The section assignments aren't too hard. The readings can be a bit long and boring but you don't have to read them all to get the gist of what is going on. Would definitely recommend taking it if you have any interest in anthropology or archaeology. It has definitely played a role in my decision to take on a secondary concentration in archaeology.","This class is extremely interesting. It gives you the opportunity to understand the past and our ancestors through looking at the things they left behind. The lectures are engaging but a little fast paced, so be prepared to rapidly type or write your notes. The sections will be a real highlight in your week because you get the opportunity to apply the most interesting concepts touched upon in class.","While this course did introduce us to archaeological methods, it was not structured very well. Lectures sometimes went off topic and the readings weren't particularly relevant to the course.",You have to love writing,"It isn't a ton of work and section is very interesting. The weekly assignments are doable, but lecture isn't always super interesting.",Anthro 1010 is a fantastic Gen Ed with great professors and a fascinating subject that a lot of people know very little about.,"I took this course primarily for the General Education credit it provides, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I had taken an archaeology course prior to this one and knew I enjoyed the subject. I think the course was excellent at improving critical thinking skills; the course focused heavily on epistemology in archaeology and asked us to be able to explain how we could ""know"" things about the past by looking at artifacts, art, written records, etc.  However, in comments for this course in previous years, I have noticed commenters saying that students should not take the course for the General Education credit if they are not interested in archaeology, and I would just like to echo that statement.  I doubt the course would be worth a student's time if the student really does not care for archaeology.","This course is quirky and fun, but push the professors to help you prepare for the exams because this year the material on the exams was unexpected.",The class was very fun and the sections meant that by the final I knew most of my grade so the pressure was off. It was fantastic fun and I learnt a lot but it wasn't at all stressful.,"It's a really interesting class if you like the material, however if you aren't into history you will hate the class. You have to like to think about life from new perspectives to also enjoy the enjoy the course.","The lab sections alone make the class. However, I don't feel as if I learned much within the class itself and I felt as if the final and midterms referenced obscure terms/topic matters that were especially hard to learn if the powerpoints aren't posted online.","Take the class if you are truly interested in the subject or must fulfill a math requirement. If you aren't passionate about it, it's tedious.","This is an incredibly interesting class, but I would only take it if you are interested in pursuing archaeology as a concentration/secondary or need to fulfill a math requirement. Otherwise, there is no real incentive to take the class considering it does not fulfill any other General Education Requirements. It is not a time consuming class. The sections are absolutely great, however the follow up assignments are not always structured the best. The exams are very manageable, and the final is not cumulative for the whole year! The teaching staff is great, and their information from lectures make up the bulk of the exams. However, the readings are also crucial given that the lectures do not always go into enough depth on each topic.","If you don't like math, use this to fulfill the EMR requirement.  Lectures are boring and not that helpful, but you should still go to them.  Do the reading and participate in section.  The exams will kill you if you aren't specific about case studies.","There is a lot of reading, but the classes and sections are interesting","This is the funnest possible way I could think to fulfill your math requirement, the resources for this class's sections are once in a lifetime (I touched a human skull!), and I really feel like I have a better understanding of how we know what we know about the past.","This course is a fun introduction to archaeology. Lectures are interesting, readings are straightforward and useful, and section is always enjoyable and hands-on. Both specific details about and the broader themes of archaeology are discussed, and a good general overview of the field is provided (whether you have passing interest or a passion).","Need a fifth class that will knock off a Gen. Ed.? This is a solid choice. Very accessible TF's. Lectures were a bit lacking but sections were great. The materials themselves were quite good too. Pay a lot of attention in section, and to section assignments, and this will be a very straightforward class.","If you're looking for an EMR with no math, you've found it. This class was a great way to get rid of EMR without having to look at a single number all semester. It was enjoyable, the sections were usually somewhat fun, the lectures were pretty engaging, and the work was pretty simple and straightforward.","It is actually an introduction to archeology presented in a way that Indiana Jones would do. I am a Science-focused person concentrating in CS and I find that this class is just perfect to learn about a great deal of a history in a very interesting way - instead of studying the life of kings and battles which History focuses on Anthro 1010 will show you what the everyday life throughout the centuries looked like because through the excavation it investigates the realities of individuals underrepresented in a written record such as slaves or peasants. What I particularly liked is that it actually teaches you how to excavate, how to look for the sites and that, sadly, Indiana Jones movies do not necessarily illustrate archeologists' daily lives.","If you are interested in archaeology, or you are simply dismal at math, this course is a godsend for you.  Overall, it is not terribly difficult, it has really fun and interesting sections (field trips to graveyards, the ceramics studio, stone-tool making, bone analysis) and it involves literally no math at all.  

This year it was co-taught by Professors Ur and Tryon.  Tryon was not my cup of tea: his lectures were disorganized, making handwritten notes impossible to format logically, and he has a habit to ramble, while also mumbling, which makes note-taking rather laborious. He is very fun, though and quite knowledgeable of course.

Ur I liked a lot. His lectures were smooth and logical and he is quite engaging.

The TF's (Max and Sadie) are both awesome. Shoutout to Max for being so nice and always so helpful.

The average reading, including sections, was 147 pages per week (that is, about 75 pages per lecture).  The tests are ridiculously easy, so don't kill yourself studying.

Fair warning: the reading that they assign is like my mom's fruit bars: dense and incredibly dry.  You do not need to know even half of the random details the textbook includes. ***GO TO OFFICE HOURS BEFORE THE MIDTERM AND EXAM: your TF's will tell you what is important and what you don't need to worry about***

If you are interested in archaeology, this class is for you! And if not, it is still quite fun and if you are aware that the reading isn't as integral as it may seem it is stress-free.",Not worth taking for a gen ed.,"I enjoyed the varied course material (e.g. scholarly articles, textbook readings, videos, movie theater excursion), engaging professors and TFs and hands-on lab sections that Anthro1010 provided.","Not only a fun, thought-provoking, informative course, but also a great way to fulfill the Math Gen Ed!","This class is a fun introduction to anthropology and archaeology, but even if you're not interested in either of those fields, it is a great way to gain more experience in analytical thinking."
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1095: Urban Revolutions: Archaeology and the Investigation of Early States,Lots of learning about a different society,"If you are looking for a very interesting class without a heavy workload, then this is the class for you.","This class was a gem. the material can be a bit repetitive sometimes (making it easier to skip class occasionally), but it's really cool to learn about how human beings developed the complex, stratified societies we see today. Cool conversation topic. The TF is an awesome dude who is more than willing to help on the *two* assignments we had all year. We also only had two section meetings. This class is awesome.",This is a great switch up from your concentration if you're not an anthropology major.,"Take it! Take home midterm and finals, good explanations of what they are looking for.",Great class gema,A good class. Take it if you need a class with a low workload.,This class is a cool way to learn some basic anthro/archaeology. I knew nothing going in and had no problems.,"This class was very interesting and the readings, though they were long, were beneficial to the assignments.",Take course if interested in history as this class will be much more for you,"This course was a fantastic overview of the study of ancient civilizations. Professor Lamberg-Karlovsky is not only a leading authority in the field, but he was an incredibly engaging professor who brought colorful personal insight into his lectures. Having no prior interest in the subject, I was surprised by how much I learned and how interested I was in the course material. As TF, Yitzchak did a phenomenal job facilitating the course and giving us feedback on our essays.",Take this class! It was easy/fun.  No downside.,very easy A,It's a good class with limited work.,This is a great class! Professor Lamberg-Karlovsky is ridiculously qualified. He has had so much experience in archeology and has traveled to so many places. He's very articulate while being down-to-earth when he needs to be. The TF was also very supportive and helpful along the way!,Very little work and difficulty comes from this class. Extremely enjoyable and unstressful.
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1130: Archaeology of Harvard Yard,this class is amazing.  even when it is cold and rainy everyone is just so EXCITED to be digging and discovering history first hand,"This course is fantastic. I mean, what other course lets you dig up Harvard yard? I learned a lot about the practical aspects of archaeology, as well as the history of Harvard. The professors are extremely knowledgeable but also very accessible and kind. Easily one of the best courses I have taken here.",This class was one of my favorites at Harvard. There are very few opportunities to be involved in an archaeological dig if you're not an archaeologist - this class was so fun but I also learned a lot about Harvard's past and public archaeology.,"This class was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my first semester, and something I brag to friends both at Harvard and from home about. It is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in a real archaeological dig. I had the chance to hold a pipe in my hands that hadn't been held since 1680. If that means something to you, TAKE THIS COURSE. You will not regret it.",The class is as much work as you put into it but putting in more hours will yield to a much better and more interactive outdoors dig. Very hands-on and the learning curve for archeology is pretty steep.,"Take it! This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard! It's so different from any other course, and reminds us how much we can learn outside of the classroom!",The Archaeology of Harvard Yard was a once in a lifetime learning experience that truly enhanced my freshman year.,You do actual archaeology in the field which is incredible. Everyone is really supportive so there's no need to worry if you have no digging experience. You can get away with not doing the readings and the assignments are really easy.,"This was an awesome class! The dig is fun -- even if its raining, less so if its freezing cold. In this class you put a lot of hard work in during class but the workload outside of class is minimal. Diana and Trish are awesome and it is a lot of fun being able to work with them.",This will be one of the best classes you take at Harvard. You get a chance to excavate Harvard Yard and find things that were left behind over 300 years ago.,"SO much fun! You will look forward to this course every week. Recognize that you will dig rain or shine, but you will have an amazing time and actually discover real 17th/18th century artifacts."
Anthropology,"ANTHRO 1185: The Talking Dead: Archaeology of Death, Burials and Commemoration",I only recommend with reservations due to the amount of reading required. The source material was highly interesting and the class was fantastically engaging. One of my favorite classes taken at Harvard yet it expects a high amount of time. Only take if high interest in the field because of the time required for it.
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1210: The Archaeology of Ancient China,"This class is really interesting and fun! You get to participate in cool activities like burning oracle bones, examining burial goods from the Bronze Age, and putting together a museum exhibit at Peabody. Just make sure you take really good notes and keep up with Professor Flad's speed during lectures and you'll be fine."
Anthropology,"ANTHRO 1250: The Pyramids of Giza: Technology, Archaeology, History: Seminar","loved this class! really cool topic and as long as you do the requirements, Prof Maneulian is great.",A different class which is good to mix up other classes with. It has a different structure and the content is interesting. Only thing is that it can get a bit tedious at times.,"Excellent course based on content, instructor, and media used. Would take another course offered by the same instructor in a heartbeat.",This course is s very interesting modern take on s very ancient time. It is truly incredible what the ancient Egyptians were able to accomplish and this course will give you such s greater appreciation for their civilization.,"Be aware that over half of the classes are taught by students. It's still very interesting, but I wish Professor Manuelian taught more.","The 3D component of the class was very cool, but I wish there was more of it to take advantage of the unique room the class was taught in.  Additionally, the class is taught largely by the students, which wasn't that helpful all of the time.","Very easy and interesting, especially if you want to learn more about Egypt than we learned in elementary school!","if you have any interest in egypt at all, take this class! the incorporation of the 3d model is incredible, and one of those opportunities you'll only get at harvard. The discussions were relevant and interesting, and student presentations engaging. i would definitely recommend!","The Professor does not teach the class, the students do. I felt duped, and cheated by the class. Very little feedback or idea of how I was doing. Would not recommend. It was a waste of a credit.",This is a really interesting course with a great professor and engaging material.,Great class; professor basically needs you as unpaid labor for his Egypt research but his research is pretty cool and the class is actually AMAZING for all the stuff he shows you in 3D. Worth it.,"This is great course if you have any interest in Egypt. The course load is very manageable, making it an enjoyable elective. With that said, a good portion of the course is student presentations. If you don't enjoy those, you may not enjoy the class as much.",This course is great. Professor Manuelian is really passionate about Giza and it comes through in class. I took this as an elective and I'm glad I did.
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1600: Grounding the Global: Anthropological Approaches,"This was a really great anthro class.  They totally revamped it from the entry course it used to be.  Prof Herzfeld is a really engaging professor and really wants students to take advantage of his office hours.  Classes are usually stories instead of lectures.  If you're interested even a little bit in contemporary social issues (transnationalism, international politics, housing, financial crisis) you should definitely take this. Also, Bronwyn is a phenomenal TF, definitely get her if you can.",The course is interesting but you need to keep up with the readings and the lectures otherwise it's easy to be lost.,"ANTHRO 1600 with Professor Herzfeld is great. You'll learn a lot about anthropology without realizing it, as the course is set up to introduce you to anthropology via primary literature rather than a textbook. This might sound daunting, but it really is a great and painless way to learn about anthropology. Try to get in Bronwyn's section if she's still TFing.","It's a very interesting survey course of social anthropology and covers topics like economics, politics, food, and housing/heritage.  Unfortunately it is a bit disorganized so lectures can seem like a disjoined number of examples somewhat related to the general topic without deeper analysis.","The class is successful in introducing students to social anthropology.  It covers a wide range of topics from an anthropologists' perspective and includes some basic theory.  But the points of emphasis and continuity between lectures are confusing as are some of the assignments.  Also, the material often was specific to the professor, so would change under a different course head.",A great intro to anthropology. You cover a breadth of topics in a practical and applicable way!,"Professor Herzfeld is great, unfortunately he was only here for the semester. He and Bronwyn are the reasons to take this course. If they are not teaching it, I would not recommend this course.","If it's taught by another professor and the syllabus looks interesting, perhaps give it a try. If it's with Prof. Herzfeld, don't take it.",Absolutely fantastic! Worth taking!,this class is interesting and fun- be sure to be on top of your readings so you can get the most out of lecture,"This course is a must for anyone considering anthropology, especially if you feel you don't yet understand it. Be wary of the instructor. Herzfeld is prone to tangents and repetition. Lectures were regularly a review of his travel stories more than they were an explication of anthropological concepts. Still, he is a veteran anthropologist with a full and vibrant understanding of the field.",Make sure Bronwyn is your TF.... and keep up to date on the readings.,"This is supposed to be an introduction to the basics of social anthropology but fails to live up to that name. The course is changing, as I understand it, which will be for the better.","The course is not hard and is infused with some interesting threads in anthropology academically and in its real world application, which is awesome!",Professor Herzfeld is an excellent instructor. His enthusiasm for the material and for your learning is inspiring.,"Unfortunately this class was the epitome of the downside of studying social sciences at Harvard. Prof. Herzfeld, while he tried very hard and made himself accessible outside of class, would everyday espouse a politically correct political agenda without any nuance and little evidence-based analysis. While many of the topics we discussed such as poverty and racism are terrible, every lecture was a black-and-white David and Goliath story in which neoliberal agendas hurt the little guy. Unfortunately this approach didn't provide any insight into how to actually help or understand people because it refused to do the latter.","You will get out of this course what you put into it. If you choose to engage with the texts and get to know Professor Herzfeld, you will come out of it with an understanding of anthropology and hopefully inspiration to continue this type of thinking.",This class is not a reflection of the Social Anthropology department as a whole.,"Often the class just comes across as Herzfeld just discussing his travels, not actually teaching testable material, but then there is an intensive exam on material we don't feel we've been taught. But it's fun and relatively easy."
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1606: Being Asian American:  Representations and Realities,"If this topic is one that interests you, the course does a good job of exploring a variety of angles. Very interesting topics and discussions, and the field trip and Alumni summit were informative and enjoyable as well. The opportunity to hear from other students in the class and to actually get to know classmates and their experiences in such a setting was I think the main highlight of the course - I knew everyone in the class by mid-semester, which is more than I can say for most of the classes I have taken here. Some of the lecture material and reading material was not as helpful as it could have been or as relevant to class discussions and broader themes as needed, though, and the course could benefit from having more direction and streamlining. There are 5 papers and they can get a bit repetitive, but other than that the workload was okay. Overall, would recommend - I definitely came away with a much broader and deeper understanding of the Asian American experience.","The class is not very hard and the topics cover really niche areas of Asian American history--basically whatever topics the professor had written a book in, which was ethnic beauty pageants, food, and Hell Kitty. I wish we had talked more about the issues that affect us because I think most of us didn't really care about ethnic beauty pageants. Anthropology writing is also not rigorous at all, which bothers me.","Great professor, great TF, incredible course that changed my life.","You absolutely must take this class. It will change the way you think about being Asian-American, or if you don't identify as Asian-American, you will understand an entire set of experiences that your friends and peers go through that you had no idea about before. The readings are really interesting and the workload is not at all overwhelming. This was my favorite class so far at Harvard and I really hope other students have the chance to study this as well.",Great class! It really makes you think introspectively about your experiences and that of your fellow peers: a joy to take!,Great forum to discuss topics on Asian American issues with other students in a structured way,"this class is so fluffy. professor yano is nice, but specializes in topics that have little to no bearing on real life. ie, we spend a ridiculous amount of time in class on things like ethnic beauty pageants (???) and hello kitty, but little to none on mental health issues, sexuality/gender issues, issues that impact your everyday life as an asian american trying to understand their own identity... if you're looking to think about/understand asia america more critically, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. you'd be better off taking asian american lit or something like that. everything also feels very high school (ie, watch this movie and turn in a reading guide where let's hope you took down a few random notes) and it's not challenging or substantive. not for lack of trying, but this class was really not good. don't feel like i got anything out of it that i couldn't have gotten by reading the books/watching the movies outside of class, and i don't think that i would even spend my time on some of those. the professor tries, but it feels like she's not totally sure what she wants us to get out of all of the random things she does.","Take this class! The pros totally outweigh cons. The class is not perfect because this was the first time the class was given at Harvard and because it was Professor Yano's first semester at Harvard. With a little tweaks, this would be the perfect and one of the most interesting classes at Harvard! 

Pros: The work load is minimal. It's just a few books, but make sure you actually read them and don't cram. Compared to most Harvard classes, the work load is reduced by 80%. (It's a essay every 2-3 weeks and a book every 2-3 weeks. Totally doable!) Professor Yano will give you benchmarks to help you with writing essays and the TF is totally willing to help - just ask. Don't be afraid to ask questions to Professor Yano and Zoe. Just because the work load is easy doesn't mean that you don't learn anything. You are continuously exposed to a lot of films and Asian American figures. It's not one of those class where the material gets old, because it's the same material repeatedly. Instead, Prof Yano covers different ethnicities, adoption, past discrimination with women, current discrimination with the model minority stereotype outside of academics and so on. You will learn and be more curious to learn more. 

Cons of this class: the transcription took FOREVER! The essay topics are very open ended, so people can study/write about whatever! If you are not used to open essays, it can be daunting. Some of the speakers are off topic (but all the films were all on point! Kenny Endo as a speaker -- AWESOME. BEST ASIAN AMERICAN EXAMPLE EVER.) Sometimes the lecture material goes over your head. Most of the time you just wish you had more time to go over the material and had more discussions, especially on the books since they seem like isolated material. 

But like I said, the pros outweigh the cons. And I would highly recommend the class!","The subject material is interesting. Zoe, the TF, is pretty great if you take the time to get to know her. Professor Yano also has the best intentions but Zoe is better at connecting with the students. It's a pretty chill class (there's no section, so you just need to be prepared for in class discussion), but there's not a lot of the direction from Yano for papers.","Though I don't believe it will be offered next year because Yano is a visiting professor, I would say -- build on the relationships you make in the course and have more discussions outside the course.","Get ready for a lot of writing that is very inter-related, but to talk about subjects that can be personal in the best way","I really loved both Professor Yano and Zoe! They are some of the most caring and engaging people who really care about students. This has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard so far, because it really allowed me to think about my identity in a deep way. Beyond that, the class size was awesome and we became a lot closer as a class through the topics and discussions. Take this class!!! It is so worth it! It really made me feel like I had valid things to say, and gave me confidence in other classes as well!","This class was fascinating; between current events on campus and the historical overview provided by the course itself, I felt far more informed of the present state of Asian American identity in the United States and elsewhere after completing this course than I was before enrolling. The readings were intriguing, as were our in-class discussions, and I would highly recommend the course to any with an interest in the factors that shape modern Asian American experiences of race, ethnicity and identity.","Zoe and the people in the class made it. If Zoe is TF-ing or even teaching the class again, you should take it. It was also just a great forum to hear other people's opinions on a subject that I personally cared quite a bit about. If you don't care, though, this class is very difficult to drag through. Even with caring, though, it still felt like it dragged a little."
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1610: Ethnographic Research Methods,"This class teaches you what anthropology is and about the various methods that anthropologists use, which is very important. However, I felt the assignments for the class were too many. We had to write 3 pages single-spaced for the class very week which I felt were way too many and did not give us enough time to engage with the methods and develop our ideas about each method. However, I still did learn a lot about the ethics of research and the nuts and bolts of anthropology which is knowledge I know will serve me a long time to come.","I thought students had to do a lot of self-teaching and experiential learning in this class.  Since the coursework for the class is mostly a series of small ethnographic projects with very open-ended prompts and instructions, I felt like learning and growth were predicated on student effort and attention to the class to a much greater extent than in other courses.  For instance, one course assignment essentially asks students to conduct participant observation in a public place with a research question in mind and then to write a four page paper about the experience.  Since students had to choose both a location and a research question (as well as how much they would engage with others at their research site), student thought and preparation in designing the study and student presence and effort doing field research determined a lot of what students, to my mind, could get out of the course.  With that in mind, I would recommend that students try to take this course in perhaps an easier semester or one in which there is ample time to spend thinking about these exercises, because that is how a student will get the most out of this class.","You have to take this course if you are an anthropology concentrator so might as well enjoy it. I personally did my best to find the most interesting topics I could for each weekly assignment which were basically applications of the 'method of the week'. However, due to the terrible timing of the assignments/lectures/sections, explanations of how to conduct the necessary research or work for the assignments were at the barest minimum and left me more often than not, confused and alone in my attempts at completing the assignments. Also, there is also a workshopping of two of the submitted assignments from the past week which was good for like 10 minutes. After that, it's a whole hour of saying the same things and lectures were basically just like that.",You can orient all the projects in whichever direction you want to. This is really cool if you're planning on working on a thesis.,"The main learning experience of this class comes from assignments and practical discussions about different methods. TFs are very helpful and open. However, lectures and often sections are a waste of time. The same things could be covered in twice as less time with more intensity.","This class is an incredible opportunity to study the culture and environment we live in at Harvard and work with great anthropologists. It is a fantastic class in which, if you're an adventurous person, you'll do some of the most worthwhile research on campus. The sections are amazing, especially if Zoe is your TF. The lectures are alright, they go on for too long, but they only meet once a week for 2 hours and the environment is very relaxed. It is a lax class where you pretty much get exactly what you put in to it. I loved it, I would encourage everyone to take it, since it will cause you to critically examine everything around you in a fantastically interesting way.","This is a great hands-on course where you can practice being an anthropologist and performing fieldwork.  It really gives a great overview of the different qualitative methods, which is great if you're going to do a thesis involving qualitative research. You will also get to learn about the evolution and history behind the field of anthropology as well as ethical questions, which was interesting.","This course taught us a lot about ethnography and was incredibly manageable work-load-wise...I loved it! How much you'll enjoy this class mostly depends on the TF, because they're really the one who will be interacting with the ethnography you do, but Zoe is amazing!","This class was helpful in the end, but a little disorganized. If it becomes more organized in the future, this class will be a more valuable introduction to ethnographic research."
Anthropology,"ANTHRO 1636: Latin American Cities: urban images, landscapes, and citizens"
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1640: Language and Culture,Very difficult course but the material is interesting. The lectures can be very eye opening if you have read the texts carefully.,"The reading can be very very confusing. I feel like the way I view language and culture has changed in this course, but still in a way I don't fully comprehend myself. There is a ton of complicated vocabulary in this course that the teaching staff seems to combine and throw out at random which can extremely difficult to grasp.","The good: fascinating topic, great readings, fun papers, pretty useful lectures.

The bad: a professor who doesn't always seem to want to help you to understand what he is saying (i.e. lots of jargon, defensive answers to probing questions, obscurantism, use of language to form a hermetic seal against the possibility of being proved wrong), along with many readings full of inflationary language.","If you have even the slightest interest in the relationship between language and culture, then this is the course for you. Professor Harkness is an amazing lecturer and you will feel like you understand the universe on a deeper level when you hear him speak. Sections with Vivien are tons of fun and she is amazing at facilitating discussion and enthusiasm (seriously, one hour is not enough time when you talk with Vivien). The readings are super interesting (SO READ THEM) and I am not exaggerating when I say that I totally have left this class with a new-found understanding of language and culture. Assignments can be a bit difficult (there were only three essays) but totally forces you to think about everything you have learned in the course.","This class was challenging, but fantastic, enlightening, and well worth the effort.  Don't be scared by the challenge--this class is introductory, and though previous experience in anthropology helps, it is definitely not necessary (I didn't have any).  I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to anyone at all interested in anthropology.","Make sure to do the readings every week, and come to section prepared with specific questions. This class is very much dependent upon your own commitment -- if you put a lot in, you'll get a lot out.","I would say that the only way to really enjoy the class is to have a genuine interest in the connection between language and how people see its function in different societies. The readings can be really technical and almost impossible to get through, but I would say that it's been the most rewarding course I've taken. Vivien is a great tf, and helps make the material much more accessible. Prof. Harkness is great, and his lectures are fantastic."
Anthropology,"ANTHRO 1658: Law, Culture, and Islam","This is a spectacular course for anyone interested in law, anthropology, or Islam. If you are uncomfortable in these areas, Ahmed is great at helping you out and providing a groundwork, so don't worry. This course would not be beneficial, however, if you don't have an interest in rights and the challenges that Islamic law and Muslim culture present to liberalism. If you do have this interest, this course is a must-take.","If you're at all interested in Islam or Islamic law, take this class. You will love it – and you'll learn so much, too. I'm a math major – I took this just as an elective – and it was probably my favourite class this semester.","It was a difficult class with a lot of reading, but the materials were interesting and Professor Ahmed was extremely knowledgeable.",This is a great class to take if you don't know very much about the sharia and are looking for a solid grounding. It's also great if you want to introduce yourself to anthropology through a non-intro course.
Anthropology,"ANTHRO 1804: Tasting Food: Politics, Science and the Senses",really fun and interesting class. different from most other classes taken at harvard!,This class is amazing- but only if you truly care about the topics and want to invest time in deeply discussing specific points of food.,"Strongly recommended, you will really enjoy the class and taste real food throughout the semester!",This is a great class -- it provides an interesting discourse around the culture and anthropology of food. The professor is very insightful and curates a top notch set of topics to discuss. Definitely take it if Nico is still around!,"It was probably the class that I enjoyed the most this semester, because the professor, the students, the content, and the atmosphere for discussion all worked very well together. If the topic is of any interest to you, I would highly recommend it!","If you're interested in food, this course will give you a great view on the social sciences analysis of food-related issues. Nico is a friendly, knowledgable professor and I had a great time in the course!"
Anthropology,ANTHRO 1832cr: Sensory Ethnography III: Studio Course
Anthropology,"ANTHRO 1988: Kinship, Citizenship, and Belonging: Seminar",This course will inform students about the formation of societies. Its a perfect introduction to Anthropology studies,"This class is a lot of work - be prepared for theoretical heavy-lifting and to either sink or swim every class. But throw yourself in -- the water is warm, and fascinating!!!","This course is an excellent introduction to theories of kinship, which Professor Meiu also ties into citizenship very effectively. This course provides connections to a host of older literature, but then moves forward to consider the ways in which kinship is highly relevant to students interested in colonialism, nationalism, issues of citizenship, migration, and the state. It's also an excellent introduction into anthropology, since discussions range over methodology and the ethics of anthropology as well.","Read the readings, write quickly in class, go in for questions at office hours.","This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Professor Meiu is fantastic and fascinating (go to his office hours!) and leads the class energetically and skillfully. The content is great, and makes you re-think not only the way you understand kinship, but also all sorts of facets of human interaction and identity-formation. 

I think it might be a bit harder for a first-year or someone with no social sciences background at all to access the content and discussion, but that's not to say that this would be impossible, if that person was really interested in the material--Professor Meiu was careful to give background and context for everything that we read and it made the content much more accessible than it would be elsewhere.","Interesting sections and a fascinating, intelligent professor.",I have already recommended it to several people with a lot of enthusiasm!,"This course is a great way to expand your knowledge about kinship and improve your background in feminist, Marxist, and queer theory. The theory can be quite dense, so you should be prepared for a few difficult readings.  The professor does a good job explaining the material."
Anthropology,ANTHRO 2000: Osteoarchaeology Lab,"One of the most difficult classes I've taken at Harvard, but also one of the most fun. I've definitely learned so much, and I will miss this class!"

Anthropology,ANTHRO 2626: Research Design/Proposal Writing,"This course definitely meets everything you expect to learn from a graduate seminar. Professors will read every single word you write and give valuable comments, corrections and suggestions to it. Strongly recommended!","The class will help you shaping your dissertation project and most importantly, prepare you to submit grant proposals for the fieldwork.",Do not miss an opportunity to take this class if Jean and John Comaroff are teaching it.,"This is one of the most helpful courses I have ever taken. Not only are the Comaroffs incredibly generous with their time but they also relate extremely well to every student's topic. Also, this course helped me tremendously to think thoroughly through my research project at an early stage, which I found very helpful and productive. No course I would recommend with more enthusiam."
Anthropology,ANTHRO 2650a: History and Theory of Social Anthropology: Proseminar
Anthropology,ANTHRO 2660: The Anthropology of Knowledge: Seminar,Read closely and carefully but keep the big picture in mind! Don't get lost in the details.,An incredibly interesting topic; the materials and the discussion will not disappoint you. Prof. Herzfeld is a great resource.,"The discussions are very stimulating, with a focus on specialization in anthropology but relevant just for intellectual curiosity even if you are not an anthropologist. Herzfeld is a great thinker and critic, and is very supportive.",It was one of the best experiences of my life! At first it was like jumping into the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim...but somehow your survival instincts teaches you how to get smoother at moving through the water.
Anthropology,ANTHRO 2704: Linguistic Pragmatics and Cultural Analysis in Anthropology
Anthropology,ANTHRO 2722: Sonic Ethnography,Be adventurous in your choice of site as focusing your projects around a rich sonic environment will be a rewarding experience.,to get a chance to explore sonic sense,I recommend this course to ethnomusicologists or musicians BUT NOT to people interested in bridging sound outside of these disciplines. The class is not theory friendly and the intellectual discussions are very poor and anachronistic.,Don't miss this one,This class focuses heavily on sound recording and production. I think it would be most useful for students who have a very clear idea of a sound project they would like to pursue and need a venue for assistance toward that goal.
Anthropology,ANTHRO 2855: Deep China: The Moral Life of the Person: What Anthropology and Psychiatry Tell Us About China today,"This course open a window to discuss what really matters in the contemporary China not only in a anthropology view, but a view of real thinkers.",A class that will make your thinking more open and flexible.,"You can learn a lot from this course, even if you come from China. However, Prof. Kleinman is not very approachable, so be prepared to finish a research paper on your own.",Definitely a great class.,This course was life-changing. It introduced me to several new ideas that have deeply influenced my research on narratives of otherness. Professor Kleinman is deeply dedicated about what he does and has a wealth of experience which he willingly shares with the class. The space he managed to create was inspiring. Please do yourself a favor and take this class.,"The readings are amazing -- immensely readable and fascinating. They will expose you to a breath of interesting issues facing contemporary China, and uproot a lot of the misconceptions and preconceptions you may have about the country. Professor Kleinman will astound you with his insight into Chinese culture and his sheer knowledge of all things anthropology, social theory, and psychiatry. If you are interested in learning about social change in modern China, this is the place to be!",Incredible depth and great readings.  Not much work besides reading a book each week -- I strongly recommend it!
Anthropology,ANTHRO 3200: Dissertation Writing Workshop in Social Anthropology
Astronomy,ASTRON 2: Celestial Navigation,"This course is not easy, but it absolutely changed how I look at the world. I love being able to actually understand the night sky and predict what will happen based on (really counter-intuitive) models that we developed in class. Really an amazing experience.","This courses provides a fun, instructive, and exciting way to delve into a field of study that may not have even previously crossed your mind. The enthusiastic and unique styles of teaching masterfully blend theoretical study and practical application into the perfect course.","Astro 2 is an unique course that's unlike anything you've probably taken so far at Harvard - there's very little lecture and class is spent primarily on lab-like activities helping you learn navigation techniques based on the position of the sun, moon, and stars. I definitely see the sky a lot differently after this class - it really challenges your preconceptions about, for instance, where the sun and moon are in the sky at any given date. Phil and Eliza are great and help to create an engaging learning environment, and psets and exams are reasonable and fairly graded. However, I would note that this class absolutely eats your Tuesdays. 5 hours of class in one day is tough, and I often left at 10 feeling exhausted even though I didn't have any other commitments that day. This goes twice if you live in the Yard or on the river, as it's quite a trek up to class (on the other hand, it's one of the most Quad-friendly classes in terms of location that you can take).",This is undeniably a course at Harvard you must take before you graduate.,This is an amazing class. The subject is very interesting and you learn not only about astronomy and navigation but also about how to learn. Phil and Eliza are wonderful teachers who truly care about your success in the class. They will go out of their way to make sure you understand the material. The class will consume your Tuesdays and sometimes more time than you expect but it is worth it. (That time will go into whale-watching trips and museum visits that are definitely worth your time).
Astronomy,ASTRON 17: Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy,"The class is very interesting, its a bit hard to grasp. If you understand the physics and math you will be gold cause you are learning such amazing stuff its just hard when the numbers and equations do not make sense. The lab reports are loooooooooong so do them in advanced, believe me! The homework is challenging, use the office hours. Read the book as much as you can, its long but easy to understand and really cool. This is NOT an easy A class so do not take it if that is what you want, take it if learning about space is interesting to you.","This is a great course. If you want to have your mind blown consistently (almost every class), and are prepared to do some cool physics along the way, then you'll love this class. It explores some of the most conceptually interesting aspects of the entire field of physics - discussing dark matter, dark energy, pre-big bang conditions of the Universe, and everything in between. Professor Eisenstein is a great professor who is super enthusiastic about the material and who loves seeing people understand and succeed. The exams were quite tough, but not unfair. A lot of qualitative and also quantitative materials to study, but it's worth it because you'll walk away from this class feeling like you actually learned something! Not too much workload throughout the year either.","I took this class hoping to gain an understanding of how the Universe works, and how we know what we know about it. The course taught exactly this. If you've ever seen figures like ""the mass of the Sun is ____ kg"" or ""the Universe started with the Big Bang"" and wondered how we could possibly know such a thing, this course is for you.

I took this course on top of a difficult schedule and found it fairly manageable. Don't let difficulty dissuade you from taking the course if you're interested (if you're good at high school calculus).","It's a necessary class for Astro concentrators and secondaries. That being said, I wouldn't really recommend this class to those who just have an interest in cosmology (which I venture to guess is a pretty uncommon interest). The course is very punishing scheduling wise, but the material is doable if you go to OH.","If you are looking at this as an elective or gen-ed, there are more glam (and less mathematical) gen-ed astronomy courses.  If you are a concentrator or secondary or enjoy physics problems, the class is of appropriate difficulty and has great problem sets.","Overall this is a pretty solid course. If you are looking for the most introductory astronomy course, I recommend that you take 16, as it covers less material at a slower and more in depth pace. This course was neither too easy nor overwhelmingly difficult. Many concepts in cosmology are difficult to grasp, but the course material is nonetheless very interesting. Overall, the assignments and exams are pretty reasonable. I have definitely taken worse courses.","The material of the class is extremely interesting, and Professor Eisenstein is great! You get to use the Clay telescope on top of the Science Center, as well as the radio telescope at the CfA, which is really cool. However, I thought the different components of the class (i.e. lecture, readings, problem sets, labs) could have been more closely related.","This is a fun, engaging, and informative class. It requires much less prerequisite knowledge than most people believe is needed. Anyone who has taken high school physics and high school calculus is more than prepared for the topics covered in Astro 17. The weekly p-sets are moderate in difficulty, and are usually full of interesting and concrete problems. There are two labs during the semester; this year the first involved observing the Perseus Galaxy cluster on the Clay telescope, and the second involved creating a galactic rotation curve using the radio telescope at the Center for Astrophysics (by the Quad). Both labs were very educational and interesting, though they required an 8-10 page lab writeup. Overall, I was amazed by how much I had learned about the universe by the end of this course. I encourage anyone with the slightest interest in astronomy to take Astro 17.",Its a good intro Astro class. Typical lecture and pset style. Prof. Eisenstein is a good lecturer and sometimes makes funny remarks (ie something about ancient dinosaur astronomers).,Astronomy 17 is an excellent course!  It provides a very strong foundation for Astrophysics.  Professor Eisenstein is a superb professor!,This course was a very nice and thorough introduction to galactic astronomy. The book was fairly easy but qualitatively useful and the math was supplemented in the lectures.,"The class covers a wide range of very interesting topics, and in my opinion, Professor Eisenstein is an effective lecturer. As a physics concentrator with no background in Astronomy, I found that Eisenstein has very different methods of thinking about problems than the methods I have encountered in physics, which has definitely widened my perspective. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Astronomy!","Unless you plan on concentrating in Astronomy, this course is probably not for you.  I took it hoping to explore a topic I had little background in just because I always thought that astronomy was a cool and interesting field.  However, the problem sets were very challenging and tedious, having more to do with equations and rearranging them than actual astronomical ideas.  Moreover, the two labs in the class, though fun and interesting to perform in the laboratory, required 10-page write-ups, which really weren't necessary given the simplicity of the actual lab results.","This is an awesome class! It was way better than Astro 16, and I feel like I learned an immense amount. I definitely still have questions, but I feel like I'm in a much better place in terms of actually understanding how the Universe works than I was at the beginning of the semester. Don't take this course just for the qualitative material, though. A few of the PSets were a bit tricky, though most were very straightforward, and overall the math/physics portion is the main focus of the course. The labs were pretty cool too, though definitely not as cool as the ones in Astro 16 were, which was a bit of a letdown. Overall, this class is super rewarding and should definitely be taken while you're at Harvard - don't miss out!","This class was pretty good! It is very well organized and well structured, but there is a lot of work, so keeping up is incredibly important. The textbook tends to change every time this class is taught, but generally they're smooth and informative reads. That said, as a very structured class, there isn't much room for deviation and/or creativity on homeworks and labs: grading and comments can be VERY nit-picky. However, all in all, this was an extremely interesting experience. Eisenstein's lectures are all fairly good and he answers questions extremely clearly and well. I recommend it highly!",Pay attention and make sure you are awake fore every lecture. I found that going over notes after class was really helpful because sometimes it fells as though Prof. Eisenstein is going off in tangents but in reality he is explaining everything in a very detailed manner (so its is easy to loose track of what he is talking about).
Astronomy,ASTRON 91r: Supervised Reading and Research
Astronomy,ASTRON 98: Research Tutorial in Astrophysics,"This is a great course for anyone interested in astronomy research. The best advice I can give is to choose a project that 1) you think is interesting and 2) is going to be supervised by someone you get along well with. It's so vital that you and your supervisor communicate well with one another. Because there are a lot of different projects to choose from, recognize that some projects are significantly harder than others and you only really have a very limited amount of time to work on them!",Be careful who you choose to be your advisor,This is a great introduction to astronomy research and the field in general. Definitely take it to develop necessary skills and to see what research is like.,"This was one of the better courses I've taken at Harvard. I really enjoyed the weekly lunches with different professors in the department. In terms of the research project, it really is up to you to stay on top of your work. It helps to have an advisor that's engaged and available to meet frequently. If you manage your time well, the course is extremely manageable."
Astronomy,ASTRON 99: Senior Thesis in Astrophysics,"Be prepared to spend a lot of time (15-20 or even more hours a week), but it's probably the most rewarding thing you'll do. Also, picking the project is key to make sure it is completable.","If you're writing a thesis you have to take this class so this comment won't sway you on that, but just know that your assignments won't be well-explained and you likely won't get any feedback on them."
Astronomy,ASTRON 200: Radiative Processes in Astrophysics
Astronomy,ASTRON 201a: Stellar Astrophysics,"Take this course if you are after a holistic and theoretical understanding of a variety of fundamental topics in stellar astrophysics. The coursework is reasonable in quantity and difficulty. You can really learn a lot about a particular topic from the project, too."
Astronomy,ASTRON 251: Quantum Mechanics for Astrophysics,"Good for fulfilling the physics requirement.  Not much work, and gives insight into how atomic spectra are calculated.",This is a solid course covering a range of basic (and some advanced) topics in quantum mechanics.

Biophysics,BIOPHYS 170: Quantitative Genomics,"The course material for this course is interesting, but there are a lot of factors that make this course a very inhospitable way of learning it. Lectures were very scattered, disorganized, and difficult to follow; no lecture notes are made available online; assignment due dates remain mysterious and unannounced until very shortly before their due date; assignments as announced at the beginning of the semester are not necessarily the assignments you'll complete (we were told that we'd have 3 problem sets but only had 2); the schedule for journal clubs changes frequently; assignments that are required (specifically, providing responses to journal articles before class via an online google doc) are not made available until mere hours before the due date; and, finally, we never got a single grade back for the entire course. A few of these logistical difficulties would have been tolerable, since the course material is so interesting, but after a while it just got so annoying that I started to regret taking the course. Take this if you're interested in the material and can tolerate this level of disorganization in a course; if you can, it's probably worth it.","- course is very disorganized
- material is not particularly interesting and also rather unrigorously taught
- don't expect your psets to be graded
- lectures are often uninspiring",This class is a waste of time that our program requires us to take. Maybe with a better professor something valuable would be learned.,It's an interesting class with good material. Hopefully it will be better organized in the future.
Biostatistics,BIOSTAT 230: Probability Theory and Applications I,"The exams are challenging, but the course is really interesting. The TAs were a huge help and the professor was as nice as can be.","The course in difficult, very importa and useful, but it is very time demanding.","I had already taken essentially the same class at another institution, but I still found it challenging and interesting. It is a thorough grounding in probability theory. Many of the homework problems from Casella & Berger are not difficult probabilistically, but rather require a lot of calculus ""tricks"" which are annoying. Our TAs helped us a lot with these. Also I recommend that everyone attend the section/lab meeting since working the practice problems in groups is an excellent way to learn. In fact, I would almost say it is more important to go to the section meetings than the lectures.",Be perfect in your writing and steady in your studies.,"It is a good course if you don't have a solid background in probability.  However, if you are a Biostatistics PhD student and have a good background in probability, it is safe to skip this course."
Biostatistics,BIOSTAT 232: Methods I,Will teach you about the intuition and underlying philosophy of statistical methodology that often gets glossed over.,"This course is very useful to understand linear and logistic regression. The course is time demanding, but you will learn a lot of useful statistical tools.","This class is a great higher-level introduction to regression models.  However, it would be a miserable experience if you did not have a strong grasp on linear algebra and calculus.",Optional readings were beneficial.,Work hard at the beginning and the end will be easy.,"Download rmarkdown, and type up the assignments as you complete them in R--that will save time."
Biostatistics,BIOSTAT 235: Advanced Regression and Statistical Learning,It is very helpful for understanding statistics.,"This is an essential course on the theory of linear models and modern regression methods including LASSO, PCA, etc.  It also helps develop familiarity with techniques to solve analytical and computational problems in these areas."
Biostatistics,BIOSTAT 249: Bayesian Methodology in Biostatistics,"I found this class pretty (unexpectedly) difficult, but I came out with a much deeper understanding of Bayesian concepts and their applications. Do not take this class unless you are truly facile with R and manipulating distributions. Exams and homeworks are very time consuming. Case studies were great and gave a good picture of what Bayes-driven research is happening around the department.","This class introduces the basics of Bayesian statistics in the first half and then illustrates how Bayesian statistics is used in a wide range of applications.  Areas of application of Bayesian methods include causal inference, model averaging, and Bayesian non-parametric/semi-parametric methods."
Biostatistics,BIOSTAT 250: Probability Theory and Applications II,"The course is really tough, and there is a lot of class participation, so be prepared to make lots of mistakes.",A strong background in analysis is necessary before taking this course.,"Lorenzo cold-calls people in class, which was terrifying at first but actually ended up being for the best. By the first week, every single person in the room said something that made no sense, which stripped away ego and really created a level of comfort in the class that allowed for learning. This material is very tough, and you should take advantage of Lorenzo's genuine willingness to recap things until you understand it more clearly.",This is a rigorous course in measure theory involving fundamental concepts and results that are essential for understanding theoretical results in statistics.
Celtic Languages and Literatures,CELTIC 114: Early Irish Historical Tales,"This is a great class. You can can gain knowledge on an interesting an unfamiliar culture. Because the workload is not bad, all the assigned work is manageable and can actually get done, leading to better learning.",This class is interesting and very manageable if you are engaged during lectures.,This is a great class to broaden your horizons on a subject you would not have otherwise.,"Good intro Celtic class.  Not much concrete Irish history here, unfortunately, mostly folklore.   Although that is the name of the class.","This class has you read a lot of great stories and can be very interesting at times. Professor O Cathasaigh is a nice, but his lectures can seem a bit long at times. Do try to do all the readings as there isn't much, and it's easy to catch up if you fall behind one week. The stories are pure gold and really fun to chat with people not in the class about.",Professor O is great.

If you're on the fence about this course, definitely take it. You won't regret it! No knowledge about poetry or Celtic history required!","This is a fantastic class! Professor McKenna is wonderful and enthusiastic. The poems and stories we read were fascinating, and the assignments were actually enjoyable.

Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 17: Principles of Organic Chemistry,"To everyone that has asked me about this course so far, I have said that it's definitely challenging and very educational. I feel that Harvard students tend to underestimate their peers (or overestimate their own ability) and opt for the more challenging option when available (Chem 20, in this case), but I am certain that even experienced chemistry students will find this course sufficiently difficult. I would definitely give all students a warning that they must be absolutely prepared to buckle down and work for many hours at a time. I want to emphasize how important it is to stay on top of the material; falling behind even slightly is a horrible, horrible thing. I've seen so many of my classmates fall asleep during one or two lectures and find it near impossible to figure out what's going on for the following month, if not for the rest of the course. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Chem 17 and am so grateful to have had the privilege to take the course.","This class is worth your time. Professor Jacobson and the whole staff are hugely helpful and supportive. They care about you learning Organic Chemistry. The organization is impeccable, and the structure is ideal for a skill based class like this(psets are just check/check + and used for learning and feedback only). That being said, Jacobson will not be teaching it next year, so it's impossible to say how all this will be continued.",This is really not a bad class. The key to success in this class is time. I found that lectures were a bit dry. But make sure you understand all the problems!,This is a great class if you are interested in science and chemistry.,"It's a requirement so you kinda have to suck it up and take it.  That said, while the calss was hard it wasn't as impossible as I thought it was going to be.  The TFs were all amazingly helpful, and Jacobson really cares about making the material accessible for everyone.  Steven's midterm review sessions were amazing.  Stay on top of the psets and do all the practice problems and you'll be fine.  If you can make this your only hard class in a semester, even better.

Also buying the textbook and molecular model kit are totally unnecessary.  save your money and just focus on understanding the practice problems.","This is for people who haven't taken PS1 or PS11 yet- you can do it!! The first exam/beginning material will be more difficult because other people have already seen it, but as long as you put in the extra work at the beginning you will be totally fine! More generally, this class is actually really great even though orgo has a bad rep. It is well taught, well organized, and by the end you feel like you know a lot and have a good grasp on the material. It's just a fact that the material is hard and will take a lot of studying to get comfortable with. My biggest piece of advice is keep up on practice problems throughout the semester. The more problems you do the easier it gets.","I'm not going to fill this space with a paragraph about how difficult this course is - it's organic chemistry. You already know it's going to be a challenge. The good news is, this is probably one of the best-taught courses I've taken at Harvard so far (as a junior engineering pre-med)! Professor Jacobsen is PHENOMENAL at being clear and concise during lecture, and all of the TFs are also super available during the course of the semester. They all collectively do an excellent job in making orgo very survivable. With that said, it's definitely up to YOU to take advantage of all of those resources. I can guarantee that you are not going to do that well if you don't go to office hours, the Friday review sessions, and also practice sufficiently on your own. Overall, I loved Chem 17 because it is a course in which you get out what you put in, which makes it a very rewarding experience if you play your cards right.",Make use of all the materials the course offers. Practice makes perfect when it comes to reaction mechanisms and Prof. Jacobsen and the TFs make sure there are enough practice problems available for you. Just make sure to carve out time every day to practice. There is a huge difficulty spike towards the end of the course so make sure you have mastered all the material up to Week 9 or so when it arrives so you can spend most of your time on the more difficult material come Reading Period.,"Bad class to take, but necessary for organic chemistry requirements for concentrations or pre-meds. Really put in the time to do all of the practice problems and make sure you understand the key concepts that are emphasized over and over again in their course because those are the most important and you will definitely be tested on them.","This class is AMAZING. One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard so far. I decided to take organic chemistry as an elective, since I've heard very good things about Chem 17 and that it teaches you a new way of thinking. And it really does. Jacobsen is a very good and passionate lecturer, and the teaching staff really offers so much help to ensure you understand the material. Organic chemistry really is not as scary as most people make it out to be, and I highly recommend anybody take this class!","If you're premed or enjoy a mechanisms based approach to chem, take it","If you're debating between Chem 17 and Chem 20, I think that Chem 17 does provide a pretty solid understanding of organic chem - Jacobsen is a great lecturer, and overall this course does build a solid, intuitive understanding of orgo. Friends of mine really enjoyed Chem 20 but often really disliked Chem 30, and I think the 17/27 sequence is not a ""lesser"" education than 20/30 - it just has a more biological and mechanistic focus.","Be aware that PS11 will help you a lot throughout the course with the conceptual parts, but you can get away with taking Chem 17 without it. Be prepared to not understand a lot of the ""little"" conceptual things throughout the course. At the beginning of the year I hated this class but once you get to the mechanisms it can be fun at times, or as fun as orgo can be. This class wasn't much work week to week but depending on your study habits you could easily spend a week straight reviewing for a midterm so be ready for that.","Organic chemistry is a difficult subject, but Chem 17 makes it somewhat manageable. Now this class is NOT easy, and unless you really like chemistry or it's a requirement, I might not suggest taking it. But if you're thinking of taking it, it's probably a requirement and I will have to say that I put a lot of time and effort into this class and still did okayish--that's how difficult this class can be. But from my experience with similarly difficult classes, I'll have to say that Chem 17 is very well-organized with a good support system that has made a difficult subject not seem too daunting to try to master. Professor Jacobsen is an amazing lecturer and he knows that orgo isn't easy and he doesn't pretend it is. And that's partly why he is so effective as a professor. And the TFs are definitely there for you and willing to help as much as you can. What it comes down to is what YOU do. I started this class not putting in as much effort as it deserved, and only when I started getting serious, did things get a lot better. I would suggest always looking over the material after every week (annotated slides, section handouts) and email your TF any questions or go to office hours. Do more practice problems than the ones done in section. Study really hard for the exams. If you do that, you'll likely come out learning a lot about orgo and not having too terrible of an experience from it. Good luck, but Chem 17 will definitely help you get through it.","This class is difficult and very time consuming but it is well organized and well taught. Prof Jacobsen and the teaching staff offer a lot of support in terms of office hours and review sessions, and you should really, really take advantage of them. I definitely wish I had. Like everyone else says, the class is pretty hard, but you just need to be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. Try not to have an otherwise difficult course load if possible. Keep up with the work (seriously, don't fall behind, it 's so hard to catch up in this class), use the resources available to you, and give yourself plenty of time to do psets and prepare for exams. Practice problems are really good- do all of them the week you get them.",Take this class only if you ABSOLUTELY need to. And be sure that you need to. Don't take this class if you are trying to decide if you're a life science of a psych concentrator. Because this class will make you a psych concentrator and will you screw your GPA in the process.,"Chem 17 is fantastic for teaching you the fundamentals of organic chemistry and how to apply them in a systematic manner, particularly in regards to Molecular Orbital theory. Early in the course, I was frustrated with how often we had to draw different orbitals and their interactions when I thought we were supposed to be learning interesting reactions. I still remember this moment of sudden clarity when I realized systematic MO theory could helped me understand just everything better. Why is the carbonyl oxygen protonated during acidic catalysis? Why is the more substituted alkene more stable? OHHHHH. This is the first great thing about this course. The second thing is how amazingly well prepared this course is. Professor Jacobsen is an experienced teacher who knows how to cover material at just the right depth to keep all levels of students interested. TFs are incredibly patient and helpful in addressing the generalizations in chemistry, especially Ania. Section handouts are the clearest, most succinct summary of lecture information I've ever seen. Section problems, psets, and exams are extremely well-written. They are fair and doable, but challenging enough to require an integration of various concepts that leave you proud of how much you've learned in this course.","This is a great course to learn the basics of organic chemistry! Professor Jacobsen does a great job teaching you an intuitive sense of organic chemistry as well as simplifies complicated topics into easy to understand models. The TF's are all very motivated and dedicated to teaching and helping you understand the material too. Overall, I liked this class better than LS1A or PS11 because they explain things very well and don't waste your time with busy work or unnecessary ramblings. The best part about the class is that your grades is only based on midterm and final, which means you can focus on actual learning and no get bogged down by grades!","The course self-perpetuated people's hatred for orgo. The class and the teaching staff were often very pessimistic on the course and their expectations (i.e. always saying things were going to be hard, challenging) and this is turn just made people more unhappy with the course and led to a lot more people giving up. This is really sad to see. Because orgo is such a cool course that has so much potential and I feel like sometimes this potential was shattered by the very people that teach the course. I wish there was a more positive atmosphere- it will make more people like orgo and make more people be willing to try.",One of the most enjoyable courses I've taken! Very well taught and organized.,It is great as long as you stay on top of the work and section problems.,"Come in with the mindset that you really want to learn and you'll be rewarded. Every week you'll walk out of lecture and section thinking that you'll never understand the material but you'll be surprised at how much you learn. That being said, MAKE SURE you do the practice problems before the midterms--a lot of questions are based on your ability to think quickly.","Although this is a challenging course, at the end of it you will realize that you have learned a LOT over the course of the semester. The teaching staff is phenomenal, and they are definitely willing to help you along the way. My biggest advice is to DO ALL THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS. Practice is really the best way to learn the material--it's like learning another language. If you're willing to put in the work, this is definitely a manageable class!","really not as bad as people made it out to be. Jacobsen is great, and sections also really help.","Professor Jacobsen is a very good lecturer; although Orgo is definitely a very difficult subject and can be very hard to stay on top of sometimes, Jacobsen makes it as easy and as painless as possible.",It is extremely hard and useless. Only take it if you have to for pre-med requirements.,"Make sure you don't fall behind, and work hard on the psets even though they aren't graded.","The class is undoubtedly really hard, but required for pre-meds. Practice a lot and ask for help when you need it. Figure out who the good TFs are early -- some can be really unhelpful while others are always willing to help.","It's very difficult because there was a lot of material and everything was different from what I've seen before, but with effort and practice, you can learn SO much.","This course is very manageable. They provided a lot of practice problems/tests prior to the midterm/final which proved to be helpful. Steven is a great head TF and super helpful. The problem sets are not graded so if there are weeks where you don't have time to do them, it's okay. The midterms are fair even though they tend to be written a little longer than given the time to take them. Overall, I would recommend this course for those that have to take them.","Be sure to do all the practice problems you can get your hands on. Don't worry so much about the textbook, only use it if there's a concept that you're still struggling with after asking a TF or Prof. Jacobson. Organic chemistry is essentially pattern recognition, once you get it and practice a lot, you'll be fine. Be sure to understand the concept, and then just practice as much as you can.","Its a difficult class and it will punish you if you don't take it seriously. That said, I loved the challenge and if you treat every pset like a puzzle waiting to be solved, then you're going to enjoy it too.",Jacobsen is a fantastic lecturer. Really pay attention in lecture. Do all of the practice problems you can get your hands on. Especially don't slack before the 1st midterm--you will want to have that solid grade as comfort later on. This course accelerates--just be ready to consistently put in a high level of effort,"There isn't much to say. If your dream is to become a doctor, you will either take Chem 17 or Chem 20 during your time at Harvard. Chem 17 is a great option because Dr. Jacobsen is an amazing teacher who can help you make sense of difficult topics. It's also nice that Chem 17 doesn't have a lab component. You can spend all of your time for the class understanding mechanisms and reactions without bumbling through lab.",Be ready to work alot in this class if you want to get a good grade. Set aside time for the practice problems after section so you can get familiar with mechanisms and be ready to ask questions about theory since it is deceptively difficult,"If you're looking for a great instructor for Orgo, Prof. Jacobsen is the one for you. He makes sure we know exactly what he expects from us during his lectures. The PSets weren't graded this year. And the exams were fair (although sometimes sneaky!). But if you're really going to be a chemistry major, I think the 20/30 series would fit you better...this course seemed very broad and just taught me the basics of ochem. Nevertheless, I loved this class. Jacobsen and the teaching staff made organic chemistry as painless as possible. And I've even come to love it a little.","Don't come into this class automatically expecting to hate it and for it to be a nightmare. It's hard enough without that. Focus more on understanding than memorization, particularly for material prior to the second midterm. Look through the psets for problems that simply confuse you when you look at them and go to office hours for those. Try not to waste too much time trying to do them on your own when you can work through them at OH and get help when you get stuck.",This class was a much less painful vehicle for teaching organic chemistry than it could have been but it does not pair well with taking any other hard classes.,"It's very difficult - it's like learning a new language. It requires a lot of time, especially if you aren't naturally good at it like I was. With that said, if you work really hard and immerse yourself in it (as if it were a language) you can do well. The curve is very generous, especially if you're struggling (like I was). Its a good class though - definitely not as awful as I thought it would be.","It's hard work, but worth it.  If you put in the hours, and I mean at least 2 extra hours per section + weekend time, you can get a high B/A in this class.  You need to attend office hours with the good TFs all the time, and really punch in the concepts you don't get in the beginning.  Know your retro aldols.  Review your midterms again before the final.  Enjoy the material, learn to love it so the semester goes by more quickly.  Take the class with friends.",This course is very tough and deceivingly requires a lot of time and effort.,This course is both interesting and necessary for all students who are interested in chemistry and fulfilling pre-med requirements. I think that the concepts taught in this class are very important for learning about chemistry in terms of a very applicable standpoint.,If you want to do well you need to go to lecture and keep up with the material. This is not a class you can cram for last minute (a mistake I made).,"This course is a big challenge, but if you enter it with the right attitude and are willing to use all the resources available, it's not as daunting as people make it seem. It's not too demanding on a week-to-week basis, but come exam time, having put in the effort week-to-week makes your life much easier.","Make sure you cover any gray areas in your understanding - problem-oriented or theoretical - as soon as they crop up, because the class will start to move ridiculously fast after the first midterm. Do well on the first midterm and third, because the second is on an enormous world of material that is the most difficult over the course. You must put a few hours into this class each day (or every other day) to make sure you stay on top of the material lecture-to-lecture in order to get in the A range.","Put in a lot of work, do the practice problems, and then practice some more. This is a challenging course, and don't take it unless you REALLY need to. Some parts were definitely interesting, but I had to put in so much work for this ONE class. Also make sure that your workload is pretty light so that you can spend time on this class as you definitely will need to.","Prof. Jacobsen and his lab are an amazing teaching staff. They are very dedicated and capable. When you feel like part of a team, as Jacobsen likes to say, ""You are an organic chemist now"" you feel motivated to put the hard work that this course requires. It IS a lot. but everything you learn is beautiful and there is no memorization in this course. Everything just makes sense if you do all the practice problems and psets and attend all the lectures. If you don't do that, you're screwed.",It's very difficult so brace yourself. It's also very doable if you put the time in.,"Although a lot of students will state that this class is hard, it's actually very manageable. The problem sets are not time consuming at all, and even though the material can be challenging at times, you will not be pulling your hair out. Professor Jacobsen is an excellent lecturer.","This class is super interesting and you will walk out being able to understand why certain molecules react with one another the way they do. It is really difficult but not impossible and just requires one to make the time to take advantage of all the resources that are offered (i.e. office hours, practice problems, weekly optional lecture, etc.)","This course is very difficult and time consuming, but enjoyable if you like organic chemistry. It's definitely not for everyone.","The class, while extremely difficult at some times, actually made me want to study chemistry. Professor Jacobsen and the TFs really cared how well we understood the material and tried to help when they could.","Do lots of practice problems, and attend the optional lectures.",Chem17 can be enjoyable if you stay on top of it and put the time in to really understand the material.,"If you are taking this class, it's probably because it's a requirement and you have to. Given that, you should try to make the best of it. Orgo is notorious for being a very difficult pre med class, and this is hard but it is also not impossible. There are a lot of resources such as office hours you can go to for help. Do all of the practice problems and read through annotated lectures. Midterms will be grueling, but they are curved so I guess that helps. The best way to master the material is by doing different mechanisms over and over and actually understanding why things are the way they are rather than relying on rote memorization.","I would not willingly recommend this course to anyone based strictly on its subject matter. That being said, Professor Jacobsen is so phenomenal, approachable, and enthusiastic that I found myself enjoying every lecture. The course staff is there to help, and even if you struggle as much as I did, you come out of the class learning a lot.","As a sophomore who was extremely afraid of organic chemistry and almost delayed it until junior year because of not feeling mentally prepared, I can tell you whole-heartedly do not delay. Chem 17 is the best class I have taken yet at Harvard. Professor Jacobsen is a master - a brilliant lecturer, clear and concise, and humorous enough (without trying to be do!) to keep students from drifting off. That being said, he will not be teaching this course in Fall 2015 so I cannot speak for whoever will step in for him. This class is extremely difficult, but there are more than enough resources in place for you to succeed. There are annotated lecture slides which are so useless to review, section handouts are perfect summaries, there are more practice problems than you'd ever need to understand every concept in the course. Problem sets were not graded, but of course were necessary to complete to learn material. Apparently, problem set performance will play into grade assignments when it comes into borderline grades, but I am not quite sure what this means beyond that. Head TF Steven Banik is perfect for this course, and the TF staff is incredible and so helpful during section and office hours. Please do yourself a favor and take Chem 17. I am a better student and harder worker because of it, and you will be too!","Organic chemistry is daunting, but this course breaks it down to be not intimidating at all. Do the practice problems, and you'll be just fine. Reach out to the course staff; they are amazing, understanding, and helpful. Jacobsen is a really great lecturer, so be respectful during class. Make a study group and go to office hours. If you live in the Quad, there's an amazing science help table (but basically just for orgo) in Pfoho every Tuesday - GO!","It's tough, but focus on what's interesting and let that intrinsic motivation guide you. And bring your enthusiasm to professor Jacobsen - he will return it with interest.","Very hard, but put in effort and do practice problems and you will be alright.","Like CS50, life-changing course. Take it because you have to but put the time into this class and you will get a lot out of it.","As a non-premed who was taking this course for concentration requirement, I would say this course isn't as bad as people say it is. But be prepared to devotes hours learning the material early in the semester- there is a steep learning cure for the first month. After that, everything starts making sense.","You need to have the time/willingness to devote to this if you want to learn. Everyone is really helpful, but it has to come from you.",You should invest the time in learning mechanisms upfront. Do them over and over until you can do it from memory. Don't let the Prof/TF fool you: the exams are largely an assessment of how you can recognize and recapitulate these mechanisms in familiar and novel chemical reactions.,"This is a very well taught class. Jacobsen recognizes that most students are pre-meds who are required to take the class, so he makes this class as accessible and student-friendly as possible. This is not to say that the class is easy (it's definitely not), but every attempt is made by the professor and staff to support students and ensure they get the help they need. The material itself is interesting, and the course is taught in a linear manner, so the material at the end builds on the first lectures, which is logical and makes it easier to study. Overall, this a great class.","If you're doing this class for fun like I was then it's absolutely great, if you're being forced to do it for pre-med, then it must suck. If you hate it this much, why are you doing pre-med?!?!",Not bad when you put time into it,"The mentality in this class is so intense.  It's like 300 premeds in one room together, and they all show up every time and are so on top of their game.  Organic chemistry is difficult material.  This class alternately made me 
feel really motivated to learn everything and understand things and be the best, or feel like it was so difficult there was no way I could ever get it.  You future chem 17 ers can do this: the resources are there for you, you need to put in the effort and you can kill this class.",be prepared,"You need to do all of the practice problems, and go to section.","I took the class as an OEB elective because I thought it would be good for me as a well-rounded student and I loved it. I think coming in with an open mind helped me to appreciate it more. Jacobsen is a fantastic lecturer and the material is difficult but very interesting and rewarding and of course super applicable in both molecular biology and medicine/pharma. You probably have to take the course as a requirement. Make sure you have enough time on your schedule to fit it in. Some weeks, it really helps to spend an afternoon just on chemistry. I wasn't sure I wanted to take the course, so I found old lecture videos over the summer and worked myself about 1/3 of the way in; that was really helpful, too.","This was an excellent and well-organized organic chemistry class.  Dr. Jacobsen is an extremely lucid and straightforward teacher, and his lectures were always engaging.  However, the material requires a lot of additional practice - be sure to study as you go, and to ask any questions as they arise, or you could quickly fall behind.","Take this only if you have to. If you don't have intuition for the material, you will struggle through and may still not get it regardless of how much work you put in, which makes it...orgo. Weekly problem sets + 3 midterms + final.","If you are interested in this material or needed to take this class as a requirement, this is a pretty good course to take. Just make sure to actually invest time outside of class and outside of psets (like doing discussion questions every week) to keep up, because just doing the basic assignments will not get you through the course on good footing.",It is hard but rewarding when you get it right and finally understand something and is extremely logical. kind of like solving puzzles.,"Go in with an open mind and a positive attitude. The material is surprisingly interesting, and you will be able to conquer it if you put in the time (albeit a lot of time). Even though problem sets may not be graded, do your best on them because they will be key concepts tested on the midterms, and feedback from your TF on psets often warn you about seemingly subtle mistakes (that they would take off many points for). Doing as many of the practice problems as you can is essential, and the Friday reviews were really helpful as well, as well as the Head TF exam reviews. Essentially, this class will eat up a ton of your life, but it is much less of a monster than people make it out to be. You can do it! :) [The molecular model kit is not really essential (rent it at Cabot Science Lib for free rather than buying it), but the textbook is helpful.]","Chem 17 was certainly difficult and a lot of work, but it was taught so well that it is hard to fault it too much. Professor Jacobsen was a great lecturer and seemed to genuinely care whether the class understood what he was teaching and the support structure of the class was some of the best I have seen during a class at Harvard.",be very prepared for the class and review material even before taking class,"It requires a lot of time and thorough attention right from the beginning. The book is less helpful than the lecture slides and problems provided in class, but it can be helpful as an additional reference. Also, it helps to go to lots of different office hours (and sometimes even sections) to find which TF's are able to explain things in a way you understand.",Honestly one of the best classes I've taken at the college. I don't consider myself to be too bright and I found that if I put in the work and adopted Jacobsen's methods of looking at problems that I could figure out even the hardest questions. It's a really rewarding class. Just make sure to be focused and don't freak out in tests. Make sure to study everyday!,"I dreaded orgo as the worst premed requirement, and actually loved Chem 17. Take advantage of office hours and do practice problems! Chem 17 definitely requires a lot of time. Also, Professor Jacobson does a great job of reminding you how this material (and the biochemistry in Chem 27) is actually related to medicine. Be open to orgo! By the end of the class, I really found it fascinating how the functional groups we learned about form into some really complicated molecules -- through mechanisms that you actually learn about in Chem 17! Approach this class with an open mind, and you might enjoy it!",The first half of Chem 17 is very well taught. Pay attention to MO theory in the beginning because it will make the rest of the course so much easier.,"I really enjoyed Chem 17. I was super impressed with the teaching staff, and I definitely feel like I learned a lot. Although orgo has the reputation of being really difficult, I think it was taught effectively and there were enough practice problems, psets, etc. to adequately prepare for each midterm and the final. I also found the course material to be interesting (which I know probably is just a matter of personal preference) but I think if you like chemistry this would be a great class to take.","If you have to take orgo or are interested in it at all this was SUCH a well done course. Be prepared for a lot of work, though. Practice problems were the way to go for me--I stopped going to review sessions and just did all the practice problems from section over again in preparation for the tests and I did great after those.",This class was amazing. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to become a Chemistry concentrator. Many students find the class difficult and do not enjoy it because the class is just a premed requirement in their mind. The class is more than this though. It is an amazing opportunity to learn about organic Chemistry with one of the best professors Harvard has to offer. Professor Jacobsen is amazing. The class is truly fascinating and I truly enjoyed it.,"Definitely do-able. While the curve is not the most generous due to the nature of the pre-meds in the class, I'm really impressed with how well the course is taught and structured. If you want the help and put in the effort, it's there. If you take the time to learn, you'll get a lot out of it and gain a much deeper understanding of organic chemistry--it can actually be really beautiful and intuitive, and I'm pretty happy with how well it was taught and did not find it to be the dreadful orgo class at all.","very hard but Jacobson is a super good lecturer, made me understand PS1 too.",You have to be really prepared.,"THIS CLASS IS THE WORST. I AM A CHEM CONCENTRATOR AND I HATED IT. TAKE 20/30, BECAUSE IT ISN'T WORTH THE HEARTACHE. THIS CLASS WAS 13 WEEKS OF MISERY. 

But honestly though, the exams were unnecessarily difficult, and filled with ""gotcha"" questions. Furthermore, you're graded against how the others in the class do. I think that if I would have waited until my junior year to do this, I would have done much better.","This was my favorite class of the semester. The material was challenging, but the hard work really paid off. Jacobsen is a wonderful person and professor and if you really get the time to know and appreciate what he does, you'll find each and every lecture valuable. The TF staff was amazing as well, emails were responded to very promptly and office hours were frequent.",This course is well taught and well designed. Be prepared to continually put in a lot of work. You will learn an amazing amount throughout the semester. Do not get discouraged if things are hard at first!,"It is a difficult class - be prepared to work very hard in this class. If you do well, though, it can be an incredibly rewarding experience. It requires a lot of work outside of class, but Professor Jacobsen is a great lecturer.","Chem 17 definitely takes a lot of time. There's enough practice material, but b prepared to spend a lot of time practicing for the midterms and exams. Definitely take advantage of the practice material! It was a really interesting class, and Prof. Jacobsen, Steven, and the TF's are all really helpful!","Stay on top of your work, attend all lectures and sections, do all the practice problems",Chem 17 is not an easy course. It requires a lot of work and a lot of time. If you are pre-med you have to take it. Take time after each lecture to review material and go to office hours if you need help.,If you procrastinate in this course you will regret it for the rest of your life.,"Jacobsen is an excellent lecturer, and the sections were extremely helpful (as someone who basically never goes to section for any class, let me tell you -- they're worth it).  Looking back on the semester, it's truly astounding how much I've learned.  I feel like I speak an entirely different language.  Overall a thoroughly enjoyable, well taught class which imparts solid chemistry fundamentals.  It's a pretty heavy workload yes, but if you are someone who is good at pattern recognition/learning new concepts quickly, the exams will be easy. If you are remotely interested in the material, take it.","It is a good course for a premed, good curve. Really wish there was a big picture lecture to connect all we learned together.",This was the best class ever!,definitely go to office hours! the tfs are super helpful! practice problems help for exams!,"The course is very hard. But take advantage of the wonderful teaching staff. The TFs are so knowledgeable and willing to help.  The lectures are good, though they sometimes don't match the problem sets will, but the sections do. And PRACTICE all the time.","be on top of everything from the very beginning. the early stuff is the easiest, and it's critical that you understand this stuff to succeed througout the semester","Class is hard and difficult but once you understand concepts, you literally get the best feeling ever - about Chem of course.",Takes a lot of time,Go to class,It's organic chemistry. It is really hard and it is not fun. You will be about as miserable as you would expect. Stay far away from this class unless it is required of you. Hopefully chem 17 will be a better friend to you than it was to me.,"Spend time doing all of the practice problems in the section packet each week, get a tutor if you need to and don't feel bad about it, practice completing exams within the allotted time period (that may be the most difficult part of the course).",Practice doesn't make perfect...but at least improvement.,"Odds are you have to take is course anyway. The bat thing you can do for yourself is doing practice problems throughout the duration of the course. Do not focus just on mechanisms, but perform the mechanism in the context of complicated practice problems. This is the best way to learn the mechanisms. Use the materials that are available to you, spend lots of time studying, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, and you can totally do well in his class.","This is a really well-designed course, but be prepared to work work work. Especially if you don't get it right away, like I did. There's definitely a learning curve, and believe me the faster you can learn the basics, the better off you'll be. Be prepared to work really hard the first few weeks; it'll help you so much later on. The practice problems are sooo helpful. Do ALL of them. I also found it super helpful to read and learn the annotated slides before lecture. That way, the lecture was a recap of the concept instead of presenting this huge, abstract concept that I wouldn't understand.","At least for me, Chem 17 was a very, very difficult course--not in terms of workload but just in terms of learning how to think about the material. Mechanisms, for example, didn't click for me until the literal night before the final exam--and instructors aren't always super great about helping you figure out general ways of thinking about orgo. It's a premed course and I definitely feel that there's a very strong premed mentality with regard to mastering the material--I was told many times just to drill practice problems when all I really needed was someone to walk me through the logic of how to figure out a certain problem. If you're not someone who likes learning by repeating practice problems over and over again, I'd venture to say that you might want to take a look at Chem 20.","This class is designed in such a way that makes it really easy to fall behind without you even noticing. PSETs are not mandatory, nor do they have any impact on your grade despite the amount of time you spend on them, and most of the time they are many, many times easier than the exams. The material that is given to prepare for the exams is NEVER on the same difficulty level as said exams, and it makes it really misleading and disappointing when students think that they have done everything possible to prepare for an exam and are feeling well about the material, only to take the exam and find that none of the material resembled anything done in preparation. Overall, it's a really unfair class and the amount of effort that is necessary to do well in the class is much more than you could imagine. Definitely do not take with other important classes.","Please take this comment seriously. I took this course hearing nothing but how difficult it would be, and it was. But it is a course that, when approached with correct and efficient studying, will leave you knowing A LOT of important organic chemistry, and a not too stressful experience culminating in a grade you're happy with.

In my opinion, you just need to do a few things. Familiarize yourself with important concepts the summer before (buy a book or something). Attend every lecture and skim the annotated slides before lecture to have an idea about the material covered. Take notes on the lecture material. Do every pset alone, then check. Do all practice problems. Go to every section. Get rest and take care of your body.

It's kind of alot but if you do these things, the course won't be as difficult as people say. The only difficulty will be complex concepts that require extra explaining. 

Thanks for reading...

p.s. professor Jacobsen is a great lecturer.","If you're premed or even just concentrating in one of the life sciences, you probably need organic chemistry, and this is probably one of the least painful ways of doing it. The class is extremely well-organized and if you put in the work it's rewarding. Professor Jacobson is an excellent lecturer who tries to make the material clear without ever coming off as patronizing and the TFs are pretty good too","You should take Chemistry 17 if you are interested in organic chemistry. I did not shop Chem 20 but I felt that Chem 17 was doable if you need to take organic chemistry for a pre-med or concentration requirement. I recommend that you try to find what you enjoy about it, whether it's drawing molecules (which can be fun if you like to draw) or problem solving which is relatively straightforward! Don't be worried if exams are difficult, there is usually a generous curve.","You will definitely learn a lot of organic chemistry if you take this course and gain skills that can be applied to biology. The teaching staff are very approachable, knowledgeable, and helpful. However, make sure you plan your schedule to reflect the great deal of time you will spend on this course weekly. There aren't really any shortcuts to learning the material - a lot of practice is required.",Take an orgo course online/at a state school before/instead of this course,"This class is very difficult but also rewarding. I know most people are taking this class for a Pre-Med requirement, but if you put in the effort to this course you will find yourself becoming a much better scientist and overall thinker.","It's an EXTREMELY study-intensive course, but the knowledge seems to build on itself in an upward-spiral kind of way, so you're constantly reviewing earlier material along the way, which helps.",It's a good intro to orgo.,"If you want to do extremely well, you should spend all of your free time studying organic chemistry, and plan your courses accordingly. If you have a good attitude, and study well, you should be fine.","This is unexpectedly one of the most satisfying classes I have taken at Harvard. For people interested in how living systems work on the level of atoms and molecules, this is a great course. The workload and difficulty are very high but is definitely worth it. Make sure to stay on top of the course material every week, go to section, and take the problem sets seriously even though they are not graded. They help a lot for exams. Jacobsen is also a very engaging and humorous lecture, and by the end, you will be in a position to really admire what he has contributed to the field. Overall, not a walk in the park but a great course nonetheless.","Organic chemistry is not as scary as people say it is. Professor Jacobsen is a great lecturer who makes the material easy to understand, and even fun. Exams are hard, but curves are generous. Approach this class with the right attitude and it will be a rewarding experience.","This is a premed requirement, but it is taught well. The material is interesting if you like problem solving. There is not a huge amount of work for the course, but if you want to do well you need to allot a tremendous amount of time to studying for exams/working on problem sets to make sure you really get the most out of all the resources provided. Do as many practice problems as you can.","People's opinions on orgo depended entirely on their attitudes going in. If you see it as an annoying requirement, you may overlook the beauty of it. This was the most organized class I have ever taken. Jacobsen is not a flashy lecturer; he's just excellent at teaching without the unnecessary flair. I was impressed by all of the materials and tools we were given to succeed. Amazing course.","In this class, you gotta GRIND.  Whoever grinds hardest, shines hardest.  Gotta really study, and work hard on psets.  Also do all the practice problems.  Get a tutor.  It is possible to improve on this course.  I went from an E average to an A minus average.  Don't read the book.","This class is definitely worth taking if you are interested in chemistry then I would take this. It is extremely well taught and the psets are graded so it takes a lot of stress off. Ther are no labs either so do not get intimidated from the idea of taking orgo. This is a premed class and I was not premed, so if you take it as a choice beware that you will be around all the premed classes and there is some competitive nature in all sections and office hours!","Chem 17 was a wonderful experience. The class takes you from the basic ideas of chemistry to complex mechanisms in a way that gives you all the tools necessary to succeed. Prof. Jacobsen is an incredible person and lecturer–learning from him was one of the highlights of my college career.

Make sure to set aside the time each week to really learn what is in the lecture slides. Weeks can be on disparate topics, so one week could be easy and the next very difficult to understand depending on your experience and mindset. If you keep up and put in the work, the class is absolutely manageable and even enjoyable.

This was a Senior fall elective for me and it was the highlight of my semester. I encourage you to come into the class with a positive mindset and you will get an incredible amount from this class. Chem 17 takes a nearly impossible task of teaching organic chemistry in one semester and makes it an excellent experience.","Not very accessible to students who are generally interested in learning some basic organic chemistry. Premed-ness is heavily emphasized by professor, who constantly mentions the mcat.",only take this if your pre-med,"Get ready for one hell of a ride, this class is difficult because it requires a lot of time to review moderately difficult concepts that are taught in high volume and fast speed. Make sure you have plenty of time to devote to this course, and that you clear your weekends before the exams. The practice problems are key, but often I didn't get a chance to get to them until right before the exam--big mistake.","Your performance in this class will depend a lot of how much time you put in. If you don't understand something, go to office hours; don't wait.","If you work hard, seek out help/collaborate, and try to enjoy it, you'll enjoy it. If not, you'll hate it. There's not much more to it than that.","Though if you're pre-med, there's no way out of orgo, chem 17 is not a bad way to do it.",It's simply a fun and great challenge.,This is a really interesting course and although challenging is manageable especially with the help of office hours. The most important thing for this course is to not fall behind because it can be difficult to catch up. Jacobsen is a really great lecturer!!,Fantastic course.,You will get out what you put in- don't give up.,do lots of practice problems,"It's organic chemistry, it's obviously going to be difficult. Just stay on top of the material, go to section, and do ALL the problem set problems and extra practice problems because the only way to truly learn the material is to do the problems over, and over, and over...","You'll appreciate the organization of this course. Lectures, sections, and exams are all well executed and no-nonsense. It's challenging material but the teaching staff does a great job of making sure that it isn't frustrating. Do the practice problems. Don't get disheartened if you don't understand something at first, even under exam pressure. Organic chemistry's no joke, but you'll master it if you persevere.","It's a puzzle-solving class! You learn a bunch of mechanisms (puzzle pieces) and then pull it all together into more complex problems. Interesting, challenging, you learn a TON! Jacobsen is a wonderful lecturer, and his annotated slides are incredibly thorough. No need to take notes in lecture. Just listen and then read the slides later. Keep up with the material, do all the practice problems, and you'll stay afloat.","This is a tough course that you need to be ready to dedicate a lot of time in to do well. However, you will learn a lot and it is worth it. Go to the 'optional' stuff; it makes a huge difference.","Chem17 is a very very hard class, and requires a lot of time and effort, but it is an amazing class. It is probably my favorite class I've taken at Harvard thus far.","This class is certainly difficult, and it requires a lot of hard work and dedication. However, the essentially effort-based, relatively-insignificant-for-grades problem sets really help lower the stress level. If you make sure to stay on top of the mechanisms, you'll do great.","Chem17 was a really great intro to organic chemistry and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was appropriately challenging (but not painfully so), and I really learned a lot. Organic chemistry is awesome, and if you develop an appreciation for the subject, you'll love the class! The teaching staff is super helpful and Jacobsen is amazing! I highly recommend getting to know him after class. Also, office hours with the TFs are super helpful so go to those as well! For the exams, the best way to prepare is by doing many practice problems. Problem sets aren't really graded, so your entire grade is based off the exams -- so do lots of practice!",Don't take this unless you have to.,"Even though organic chemistry is incredibly difficult and time-consuming, Professor Jacobsen is a great professors and really focuses on teaching you the fundamental concepts underlying the mechanisms and problems as opposed to focusing on just rote memorization, the part of organic chemistry that people generally complain about. Even though it requires a lot of focus and time, it is an incredibly rewarding class and is definitely worth it!","Lectures are clear, but it requires so much work. Teaching team is great. Go to office hours. Always.","Keep a running list of all the mechanisms covered in class as they come. Professor Jacobsen will tell you this at the beginning of the semester and you should definitely do it! Make sure to keep up with the material as it comes, and I suggest going through the lecture notes before going to lecture. It will really enhance your lecture experience. Finally, practice practice practice, and not just the weekend before the exam. Chem 17 is an effort based course, but you can't expect to put in a bunch of hours a few days before the exam and do well. You need to put in the hours as the material comes, and if you do this, you will succeed.","The class is super well-taught and really well-organized! Great way to satisfy a concentration/premed requirement. Note that basically all the students in the class are premed though, so if you're looking to take an organic chemistry class for the sake of chemistry, the 20-30 series might be more for you. (The 20-30 series is synthetic, the 17-27 series is more mechanisitic). That said, you can learn a lot from this course! (I took organic chemistry in high school, and I still got a lot out of this course in terms of really understanding the concepts behind the mechanisms.)",Be ready to put a lot of time and energy into the course,"This class is extremely well-organized and Professor Jacobsen is a very clear lecturer.  No busy work.  Be prepared to work very hard for tests and spend a lot of time studying, but worth it because the material is so interesting and useful.",I don't really know how this course is different from chem 20 but it got the job done.  It wasn't as painful as I expected and Jacobsen is a wonderful professor.  Still the hardest class I've ever taken.  Yes I fell asleep in lecture 1/3 of the time but I don't really know how that could have been avoided.  Also I never went to office hours but that probably would have been helpful.,It is what you expect- Orgo is not easy- though Professor Jacobsen is incredible- thae class is a lot of work and requires that one complete all practice questions- sometimes 5 times over- but you will truly get  lot out of it.,"Orgo is not as difficult as everyone says it is.  It requires you to practice, and it requires you to know a few concepts very, very well.  A lot of doing well on the midterms is identifying what concept they want you to reference, and just knowing your mechanisms.  I found practicing the generalized mechanisms as they were written in the section handouts very very helpful.  Just be able to do that from memory, do some applications, and know the concepts, and you should do very well.  Also, you should know acidity/basicity inside out and backwards.

The cool stuff really culminates at the end, and I completely agree with the way Jacobsen mapped out the course. It's actually insane how much you actually learn and recognize and can do by the end of the course, and they really make it as painless as possible.","The section handouts were extremely helpful, but the biggest single complaint I had about the class was that the p-sets are not graded or explicitly incorporated into your final grade at all. If you are not a good test taker, your grade will suffer. Professor Jacobsen was a so-so lecturer but it's clear that he fully expects you to pick up the material and terminology quickly. You're probably taking this course because you have to, and if you devote time to consistently keeping up with the material (and getting over the initial, steep learning curve), you'll probably do at least decently in this class.","This is class is definitely a challenge because it's organic chemistry, but it is the best taught class at Harvard in my opinion. It's very well organized and extremely well taught, I highly recommend it!",work hard right from the start to get a strong understanding of the basics,"ls1a and ls1b prepare you just fine for chem 17. you do NOT need ps1 or ps11 to do well in this class if you've taken ap chemistry. that being said, this course was my hardest of sophpomore fall. balance your classes, make sure you have one really easy one to go along with chem 17. GO TO THE FRIDAY LECTURES. they're optional but they're pretty much necessary for success. so is section! do the practice problems and practice tests, and do them more than once. make review sheets, and go to office hours and help sessions. however, the material itself, while hard to grasp the first time around, becomes very straightforward and second-nature by the end of the course! be aware that there are three midterms, one of which happens a couple days after thanksgiving break, and one of which happens on the very last day of class before reading period.","It's a lot of work, but the course is structured well, and there are multiple resources to use for help provided.  Overall I found the course very rewarding.  As long as you put in the time to understand the material, I think the course is very interesting and improves problem solving skills as well as overall chemistry knowledge.  The teaching staff are very willing to help in whatever way they can, and Professor Jacobsen is very open to questions and willing to further explain aspects of the material that students find confusing (especially during the Friday sessions).  I went in dreading orgo, but in the end, although it was definitely a lot of time/work, found it very rewarding!",You will be forced to work very hard but you will learn a lot.,"This class is super cool. I don't care if you're not required to take it; you should anyway. It'll change your life. For the better, I think. It's great, but does take some time if you want to do well.","Professor Jacobson is an AMAZING teacher.  He is a great lecturer, and the section leaders will help you understand the hardest concepts.  The Professor puts in incredibly time and effort to ensure that there are ample notes/other resources available to reference, and if you are interested in orgo for more than the pre-med aspect, Jacobson's work is fascinating, and he makes a great effort to share some extended applications of organic chemistry.","It's OChem. It sucks, it's hard, but you have to do it. Office hours will be a mess, so if you need help on the psets, email your TF with your questions rather than trying to fight your way through the masses of people demanding help. Do as many practice problems as you can, and accept the fact that you will probably do horribly on the second midterm-- it's okay, everyone does.","I'm a social sciences concentrator but I loved this class. Jacobsen is a great lecturer and super passionate about the subject. Naturally, his enthusiasm was evident in his teaching and his willingness to assist students to the utmost of his ability. The class is very well-structured and provides great class notes/materials to allow you to do well. You have to put in the effort (obviously) but anyone who puts their mind to it can do it! It's a manageable class,but only you know your limits/your aptitude for science. I don't think I could have taken this class with others classes with heavy workloads so I tried to balance my schedule appropriately. Don't be afraid to ask the TFs/Professor Jacobsen for help, they are all extremely helpful and nice and genuinely want you to be able to understand the material.","Definitely a difficult class, so keep up with the lectures. The annotated slides are extremely helpful. And practice lots of problems!","it's a good class, but you NEED to put in the time every week or you will fall behind without realizing it.  pay attention in lecture and review the day's material THAT NIGHT or it will be too much come time to study for the midterm. they grade harshly on exams so be careful with your diagrams, syntax, wording, etc.","I was on the fence between taking Chem20 in the spring and taking this course. I could not have been happier with my decision. Jacobsen, although he will be on sabbatical '15-'16, the structure of the course is very organized, fair, straightforward, and stress-free. P-sets are graded based on completion and effort. They actually provide notes with the important material all nicely organized. I don't think there is another class here that does that. Take this class. If you are hesitating, because you don't have a strong chemistry background, I would still go for it. I came in with relatively little chem background (no AP chem in high school), but orgo chem is another world. As long as you do the practice problems, you'll be fine. I really enjoyed this class. It was probably my favorite class here at Harvard. The staff is so supportive. The lectures are interesting. If you go to all lectures and review lectures and sections, it will be 6 hours of class a week. And two last words: NO LAB","Orgo for me was such a struggle, but at the same time it was one of the best classes I took this semester.  It was amazing to see how much I had learned when I was studying for exams because problems that at one point had seemed impossible became relatively easy.","Chem 17 is a well structured course with a variety of good resources and practice problems, and not as scary as many make out Orgo to be. It does require a lot of practice to get good -- as does anything. I didn't manage my time correctly, didn't practice, and it showed in my low grades. Be responsible. Set aside time to do as many practice problems as you can. Read the text + annotated slides *before* class. Some might think this is all common sense, but hey -- I'm a senior and I didn't know this. I was able to get by other classes without doing reading and practice, but it is necessary in Chem 17.  It's like solving a bunch of logic problems/puzzles. 

A great class that grades very fairly. Professor Jacobsen and the TF's want to see your success, and they are very encouraging. Chem 17 gets you prepped to think the ""why"" and ""how"" behind organic chemistry. Conceptual, but concrete in that there are many applications. Really wish I had dedicated more time to this-- it's possible to do well. As I near the end of my college career, I realize that a lot of doing well has to do more with managing your time well rather than your capability.","I loved the material. If you stay on top of the work, it's not so daunting, and they provide you with plenty of study material.","This course is tough. Harvard gives you all the resources to help you get through it, but you need to take advantage of them. Go to office hours. Email your TF with questions. Put in the extra effort, and you'll benefit from Chem 17.",It has high curve.,The section handouts and doing the practice problem handouts are key. Go to Steven's review sessions. They are extremely helpful.,Make sure you take advantage of all of the practice problems.,"The class is really well organized.  In terms of a class, it does just about everything right. The con is that it is not presented the most interesting.  It is fun to figure out mechanisms you spend hours working on, but there is nothing that really exhilarating about the course! (i.e. the class is kinda boring) You learn a lot though!","There is no way around orgo being tough, but Chem 17 is well taught and Jacobsen is very accessible.  If you want to make your life easier, go to the Friday discussion sessions and just do your homework there.","Chem 17 is very well structured, and a very interesting class. Professor Jacobsen is an amazing lecturer, and not only explains difficult topics well, but keeps lectures interesting and engaging. The staff of chem 17 is all very considerate, and tuned in to the needs of the students. Also, the assignments are very useful and fun to do- after completing the problem sets, I always felt like I thoroughly understood the concepts.","If Professor Jacobsen's teaching the course, then be prepared for very boring lectures and make sure you read the post-lecture slides and do lots of practice problems.","Everybody always yells and shouts about how awful orgo is and how impossible it is. THIS IS SO NOT TRUE. This course provides you with so much material to use when studying and there really aren't many surprises on the tests. Obviously the material is difficult but if you keep up with it lecture after lecture and review all material given to you, and most importantly DO ALL THE PRACTICE problems you should get an A-, at least!!","You can make this class however enjoyable you want. It requires a LOT of time and practice to actually succeed, so if you want to do well, you definitely have to make it a priority (at times, the amount of effort you have to put in feels a little unrealistic sometimes on top of three other classes, extracurriculars, etc.). The teaching staff are really good and there is a myriad of resources at your disposal, you just have to take advantage of them.","This class is a truly fantastic way to learn organic chemistry. No, it's not easy, but the teaching staff is INCREDIBLE and they do everything to make material as simple and straightforward as possible, without skimping on depth of knowledge. The workload isn't bad at all, it consists only of 1 weekly pset and exam preparation (you are given oodles of optional practice problems). For the most part, exams are fair, and they are curved really generously. This class is so well organized, Jacobsen does such an amazing job lecturing, and TFs are so dedicated and helpful. This is not a class to dread - if you care about this class, you will be rewarded!","To do all kinds of problems that they can find on the websites and also to learn to see the connections in how molecules are made, i.e from starting material to product",Really try to understand the concepts and not just the mechanisms.,I was shocked to realize I enjoyed the course! I had moments where I doubted my abilities but practice was really all it took to understand it.,"This is a challenging class. You can do it, however, if you put the effort in. Do all the practice problems. Do them again. Ask questions. Go the review sessions. The challenge is in becoming so familiar with mechanisms and concepts that you don't have to spend much time thinking when something weird is in front of you. You see the signs right away. Therefore, do the problems. Also, try to make it that you have the opportunity to drop part of the final rather than one of the midterms. The final is much more challenging than the midterms so it's nice to have that cushion."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 30: Organic Chemistry,"This is a very challenging course, but one of the most rewarding you can take at Harvard. Even if you did well in Chem 20, be prepared to work significantly harder in this class. The first exam can be humbling and can come as quite a shock. Study hard. Read the book if you're confused, but most of the time it's not necessary as the TFs (at least this year) were absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, you won't get the privilege of learn from Professor Ritter, but the teaching staff is generally wonderful and you'll learn a TON. You'll look back at the start of the semester and wonder how you learned and understood so much so fast. Take this course! It's a highlight of my time at Harvard so far.","While this course is not actually that much work (problem sets due once a week require ~6 hours the day before and exams only really require ~8 hours of studying over the day or two beforehand), it is really stressful because the professor is constantly trying to make everyone think they're going to fail and will mock students for wrong answers during lecture.  It is also the sort of course where it is very tempting to put in a lot of extra work and end up doing no better.  If you work as hard as in Chem 20, you will do fine.  You will learn a lot chemistry and find out whether it is something you want to pursue further.  I do, however, think there are a lot more people are leaving this course realizing they do not want to be chemists than leaving the course absolutely hooked on chemistry.  I think this course could be a lot better next year with a less aggressive/more supportive professor.","This class is extremely hard.  No doubt about it - the professor told us that on the first day.  But it's worth it.  I felt that I've been put through a whirlwind of organic chemistry over the semester, but at the end, I've learned so much and now feel that I have a thorough knowledge of the material.","The material is positively amazing and you come out with a really strong understanding of what is actually going on in a reaction. Prof. Ritter started off the class saying that we would end up seeing the personality of a molecule, and it's a true statement. Though a decent amount of work is needed, you come out with a good grasp on how elegant, specific, and powerful some reactions are and a great appreciation for the genius of the scientists who invented them.",This class is by far the best taught and most interesting class I've taken at Harvard.,The course is very rewarding. But it is also extremely difficult. Make your choice.,"One: best course I've taken here. A huge amount of material is covered masterfully, and we all came out badasses.
Two: the review lectures are NOT OPTIONAL. They teach new material and explain the lecture material in new, essential ways. Go to or promptly watch all of them.
This is a damn difficult course, but it doesn't have to ruin your life. If you put in the time right away instead of in the week before the midterm, you can rock it. The first time you see a mechanism, practice it that night until it's easy.","This class is extremely challenging, but if you put in the effort and really engage with the material, it is also very rewarding. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours with the material and to grow through the struggle. However, the experience was seriously so rewarding. This class makes me excited to continue to learn about chemistry more in depth in the future.","I would recommend this with enthusiasm *to those who have enough prior orgo knowledge.*  While this class does take a lot of time, you really do learn a lot and get a chance to bond with classmates through the psets.","Chem 30 is one of my all time favorite courses at Harvard. I learned so so so much and I am really happy that I took it. i'm convinced that it's the best Intro Organic class in the country. Chem 30 is also the hardest class i've taken at Harvard. You are probably reading a million other people saying this so instead of telling you how hard it is, here are my tips for success in Chem 30 that i wish i had known from the beginning. 

1. Organize Notes in Chapters, not Lectures. I started the year organizing them by lecture and then rewrote my notes as chapters. This course is designed in chunks that are all very logical and it was hard to see connections within the chunks when i used the lecture system.

2. Start Psets as soon as you get them, even if you can't do it all. Look through the Pset on monday night and be prepared to look for what you see in the Pset in lecture. 

3. Read the assigned reading THE NIGHT BEFORE lecture. Having a basic understanding of what the professor will go into in detail the next day is HUGE. When i did this it was much easier for me to understand what was going on in lecture as it was happening, and I actually absorbed information instead of just struggling to keep up with the notes being written on the board. 

3. Consult TF regularly on an individual basis with questions.

4. Keep a list of the key concepts, reactions, and retrons you learn about and keep a list of things you got wrong on problem sets and exams.

5. Do ALL the practice problems that you can... all of them... twice. The more you familiarize yourself with problem solving the better you'll get at it and you may see a problem on an exam that is similar to a practice problem (saved my butt on the second exam).

Lastly: if you can't think of anything else, try an ene reaction :)","Chem 30 is hard. Very, very hard. If you think you've taken a hard class before, think again. However, Chem 30 is also an excellent class. You will learn an incredible amount of material and you will leave the class with a strong understanding of organic chemical reactions. Expect to spend many hours a week working on problem sets and preparing for exams (even weeks ahead of time). 

This course can be intimidating, but don't be afraid to challenge yourself if you're truly interested in understanding chemical reactions. You will not regret taking this course despite its difficulty. To top it off, there is a really great teaching staff that will help you succeed.","You learn a lot from this course, and have a great sense of accomplishment at the end of it, and throughout the course as you master concepts. The biggest thing about this course is that you need to be willing to put in the time. Expect to put in lots and lots of hours into this course, and if you do, you will succeed. The key to success is to have seen every permutation and combination of the material that they can possibly throw at you; don't try to figure things out on the exams.","As Ritter warns, this is the hardest organic chemistry class in the country. be prepared to work harder than you've ever worked and not get the scores to show for it. this was the hardest class I've taken at harvard, but I've learned so much because of it. you will leave the class with great satisfaction of how great of an organic chemist you've become, but possibly at the expense of your happiness (and sanity) during the semester. if you love chemistry and want to get really good at organic synthesis, this class is for you; if you didn't like synthesis in chem 20 then take chem 27 instead.","Chemistry 30, unlike related courses, Chemistry 17 and Chemistry 27, covers organic chemical synthesis in great depth and forces students to apply the material to synthesis problems derived from interesting and groundbreaking work in the field of organic chemistry. At the same time, it is challenging and arguably one of the hardest undergraduate courses offered at Harvard, so a great deal of time and persistence is needed to stay on top of course work.","You had better have really loved first semester orgo and be slightly masochistic to take this course. You have to be ready to spend relatively insane amounts of time on this course, or you will not succeed. Psets are hard, and not a guaranteed hundred, and this course slows down for nothing. An incredible amount of knowledge is dumped at your feet, and if you don't use every resource to put it into your brain (textbook, review lecture, practice problems), you will literally find yourself siting with a 30% or worse on the first exam. With that being said, if you're ready to spend the time and do the work, you can do well in this class. The TFs are super accessible; you can come to them with anything. Do all of the practice problems, read the textbook, and it's gonna be okay. I promise this class will not kill you. And when you come out of it, you're gonna be walking and talking like a chemist, and have more orgo knowledge than any other undergrads leaving their first years in orgo. This class will force an amazing work ethic upon you, and make you feel more stupid, and more brilliant than you ever have. If you feel ready for that, it's an amazing course. Take it.","It is hard.  Really really hard.  You can put in the time and the blood, sweat, and tears, and still not get the return you were looking for.  I loved Chem 20 but this was a whole other ball game.  Use the textbook, do the practice problems, but realize that this is one of the hardest courses you will ever take and that you will probably have to come to terms with getting a shitty grade.  If you get off on the wrong foot, it will be extremely easy to get demoralized and to not want to try anymore, especially since it will probably feel like you would get the same grade regardless.  This course actually changed my mind about being a chemistry concentrator.  I can't say that I regret taking the course, because I have learned a lot of interesting material, and chemistry has always been a passion of mine, but this class can wreck you mentally.  Of course, this is Tobias's last year, so who knows what direction the course will go in in the years to come.","I would rather skin myself alive and proceed to jump into a vat of concentrated acid than take this course again.  Hell would need to freeze over before I would take this course again.  This course effectively ruined my life, my self-esteem, and my mental well being.  There is absolutely NO way to succeed in this class unless you are comfortable devoting YOUR ENTIRE LIFE to this course.  If you take this course, you will lose friends, you will lose your sanity, and you will question your existence.  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE; AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.","Only take this class if you want to work hard, ADORE chemistry, and feel like you are very good at it. So if chem 20 wasn't hard for you and you loved chemistry-- take it. If either of these two components don't hold, heavily reevaluate if you want to dedicate so much time to a class that probably won't give you any rewards in terms of grades. Make sure you love chemistry so much that taking this class will be rewarding, regardless of grades","I rated this course as ""likely to recommend"", not because I don't think it was an amazing class but because I would not recommend it to everyone. This course is not impossible but it definitely is not for everyone, you have to really have a desire to learn the material in order to succeed. If the only reason you're taking orgo is to fulfill premed requirements and not because you think orgo is fun, fascinating, rewarding etc, then I probably wouldn't recommend it to you. I don't say these things to intimidate anyone - in fact the level of intimidation surrounding the course it a bit excessive - it really is manageable as long as you dedicate the time to it. Plus, this year's teaching staff (Gregg, Claudia, Tobius) were so dedicated to the course and helping us succeed that it was hard not to want to match their enthusiasm and succeed. Success, is relevant in the class though - don't walk in expecting an A, but do walk in expecting to be highly rewarded for your work and to learn more than any other class will teach you. In terms of advice, the three biggest things I can say are 1) do not let yourself fall behind, ever 2) find a small study ground to p-set with 3) go to office hours. Other advice would probably be to not take another course that requires a high time commitment. I can honestly say this was the best course I've taken at Harvard and although it made this semester a personal and academic challenge to test my limits I will always look back on the time and work I put in with a positive light.","I think Chem 30 has been one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken. It's definitely incredibly challenging, and you cannot underestimate the amount of time and work that this material takes to learn and understand. But at the same time, I feel confident walking away from this class knowing that I am a chemist who knows my organic chemistry - without a doubt. It feels like the amount of work and time I put into this class consumed my semester, but I loved every minute of it.","Tighten up your skates, this is the real deal.  You will never be so frustrated with a class.  You will never feel so hopelessly lost in material, so deeply convinced that you are just not smart enough to understand.  But then you will look back and realize how much you've learned and how you now have an intuitive understanding of what felt impossible only months before.  This class changes how you see chemistry and it's really quite incredible.  However, the only way to induce this epiphany is to really put you through the wringer and make you really work and struggle.  Be aware of this and don't (DON'T) kill yourself with other hard classes during the same semester.","You learn so much chemistry in this course that it almost becomes mind-boggling, and indeed the exams will certainly challenge, surprise, and confound you. But if you are willing to devote the time and effort that organic chemistry at this level demands, you'll get so much out of the course that it all becomes worth it.","The material for this class was very interesting after the first midterm, I genuinely enjoyed doing problems and syntheses by the end of the semester, and I feel like I could now look at most any complex molecule and figure out how to make it. That being said, this was the hardest semester of my life and the other classes I took were fairly easy. This class was excruciating at times and if you want to do well you can, but it will probably take over your life. It was also frustrating to feel like the course was hard at times just for the sake of being hard and certain concepts just weren't fully taught. The TFs work incredibly hard for this course but at least for me they weren't helpful. You probably have to take this course if you took Chem 30, and if you do I recommend doing all the assigned reading and all the practice problems (actually all the problems in general) at least three times before each exam.","TL;DR: Hard? Yes. Doable? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.

I'm probably not going to say anything about Chem 30 that you won't read before and after this comment, but, as this class has taught me, repetition is the key to mastery. It's by far the best class I've taken at Harvard: a brilliantly designed and executed experience that gives you a deep chemical intuition that allows you to understand not only what reactions occur, but why they occur. For real, if you do take this course, go back at the end to the first Chem 20 midterm and see how ridiculous the mistakes you made seem - it's absolutely insane how much this class (and the 20/30 sequence in general) teaches you. Of course, with that comes the fact that Chem 30 is unapologetically difficult. Do not come into the class thinking you're going to do well, even if you killed 20; 30 is a completely different animal. Most likely, you won't be able to just learn everything through osmosis by showing up to office hours and review sessions and watching whoever's running them (Ritter and his head TF Greg are leaving for Germany, so I won't be able to say much about the teaching quality of future versions of the class) write stuff up on the board; you really have to sit down and actively engage in practice problems. It takes a lot of work, and you'll start to see the stuff in your sleep, but at the end of the day (i.e., the final), everything will start to clear up and you'll be shocked at how much chemistry you've been able to internalize.",It will definitely be the hardest class you take that particular semester. Make sure to allow enough time to devote to it.,"TAKE THIS CLASS! Yes, it is a hard class, but it is also an incredibly rewarding class! Hands down, this class is far superior to the chem 17/27 sequence. Entering this class, I had some idea of how orgo worked from Chem 20, but I didn't really learn orgo and its power until Chem 30. Chem 30 provides you with a very powerful synthetic toolbox, and really makes you a real chemist. There are so many synthetically useful tools such as enantioselective aldols, pericyclic reactions and transition metal reactions that are really cool. Almost everything about this course from lectures to problem sets are top notch!","Great, but extremely difficult, time-consuming, and demanding. You learn an incredible amount -- but it will be tough.","It's different from chem 20. People like chem 20. The entertaining material covered, the high expectations, things I enjoyed about chem 20 still remain in chem 30, but without a supportive atmosphere. The expectations become too high, and the concepts become very difficult, which can be manageable, but there's no one there to catch you if you fall, it felt like. Only a man standing over you telling you you have to do better. I stayed in the class purely out of spite, but several others dropped it. Shop it and see if you can handle such an atmosphere.","This course is incredible - the sheer volume of chemistry you learn makes the course rewarding. You will be prepared to read all of the synthesis literature, and will appreciate the clever parts of each pathway. This course is also hard - it will take you apart and put you back together, and afterwards no course will seem scary. Do the problem sets on your own, then go to office hours, and do the practice problems twice. Unlike in chem 20, simply knowing how to interconvert functionality is not enough - you need to approach syntheses by figuring out how to take them apart, especially after the first exam. Take this course and your brain will grow.",A must take for anyone interested in organic chemistry!,"This is a really really good course.  It's also really really hard, so if you don't want to go into chemistry (I'm looking at you, pre-meds), don't take this class!  That being said, you learn a LOT and at the end of it, I felt really good about having taken 20/30.  During the class itself, it's hell.  Expect to spend most of your weekends working on the problem sets and the week before midterms panicking.","The tests are unreasonably difficult but the teaching staff is completely committed to bringing you up to the truly unreasonable standard expect in test preparation. The tf's will meet with you individually if you are struggling and have plenty of office hours. 

Aside from personal meetings with the  TF's, nothing will prepare you for the exams. I don't care if you look over every practice problem and memorize every lecture note, it is very easy to lose points and the exams are just not representative of your knowledge base of organic chemistry which I find unacceptable.","Listen up - this is easily one of the hardest classes at Harvard if not the hardest. Think twice before you take it, and then think again. It isn't a class to take just because you liked Chem 20. If you're a Chem concentrator then you should take Chem 30 - if you aren't - consider taking Chem 27 or something else. If you are going to take this class then make sure your other classes are easy/maybe consider taking only 3 classes. Even with that - this class will be a journey. You know how they would send young boys into the woods to trip on drugs and fend for themselves as a spiritual journey? Think of this class like that, except with less drugs and more psets. 
Honestly I had never truly understood how some people at Harvard struggle so much on a mental basis seemingly because of their classes until Chem 30. I am a really upbeat person who loves Harvard and really likes chemistry - this class straight up messed with my mental health. I can honestly say that this class ruled my life this semester and led to what has so far been my saddest time at Harvard. I know people who lost hair over this class and I know people who have become depressed because of this class. It tests your ability to learn material in a big way and pushes you to your absolute limit. 
Now, with that warning in mind I can't pretend the class didn't do what it set out to do. I do feel extremely knowledgable about organic chemistry and have developed an incredible chemical intuition. There's no doubt that I have gained some mastery over this material - but it has been a very tough experience. 
Ritter is an excellent professor - if terrifying. 
If you decide to take this class (and I do seriously recommend considering all your options before you do) then follow my advice:  a) Do the readings in the syllabus and take notes. b) memorize your reactions and your mechanisms as soon as possible c) do all of the practice problems when they come out and once again before the exams d) pray. 
DO NOT TRY AND PREPARE FOR TESTS A WEEK AHEAD OF TIME. IT WILL NOT WORK. 
I hope I've dissuaded some of you from taking this and given good advice to those of you foolish enough to take it anyway. Good Luck."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 60: Foundations of Physical Chemistry,"Chem 60 was interesting. The problem sets weren't that bad, but the exams were quite difficult (and required a lot of formula memorization). Professor Gordon is really friendly and kind, but also isn't the most exciting lecturer which made class somewhat dry.","If you're interested in stat mech/thermo/kinetics and want to learn about it in an accessible format, this is a great course!  There's something for everyone in the readings, and I found it very interesting as an applied math student.  Exams can be a little memorization-based (as in, there's no formula sheet) but aren't terribly hard, and neither are the problem sets.  The course ends with a final presentation/paper, which was a great opportunity to model an interesting system in terms of properties we learned about in the course.  Lecture style might be dry if you're not interested in p.chem, but Prof. Gordon is really interested in making the material clear and convincing, so it helps to attend if only to ask questions.","This is a great way to fulfill your pchem requirement, but if you want more than the very basics then this isn't for you.","Although this class is relatively easy and non-workload intensive as compared to 20/30/40, you will most likely learn very little from this course. This year was particularly unproductive because we received very little teaching from the course's only TF. The tests did not reflect the type of questions presented in the problem sets. The lectures are very dry considering that over 75% of the lecture is just reading off the lecture slides and doing derivations. I would also recommend checking out MIT's 5.60 as a way to supplement the class."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 100r: Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Biology,"Great class! The staff are super helpful and make lab time enjoyable. Making powerpoint presentations every week for lab meeting is kind of time consuming, and the final written paper also takes a lot of time, but it's totally worth it. Shoutout to lab manager Zack for being awesome!","Chem 100r is an amazing opportunity to work with incredibly accomplished faculty on innovative chemistry research. Through the course of the semester, you become immersed in your project and make a contribution to chemistry. One of the best chemistry courses I have taken at Harvard. I recommend it with the highest enthusiasm!",A great class! A lot of time in lab but definitely worth the experience!,Absolutely amazing advanced chem lab! Recommend with extreme enthusiasm!,"One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. I'm definitely not a ""research"" kind of person at all and really loved this class. It puts together a lot of the stuff that has no context in orgo an the project based learning approach is awesome. Also the TF's for this course of incredible and extremely knowledgeable.  

That being said, this course is a HUGE time commitment - don't take this with too many time intensive courses because it will make for a really rough semester. Definitely a class to look forward to though! 10/10 would recommend!","If you are wondering which lab course to take as a chem concentrator, I would definitely choose this one. The support and individual attention this course offers are, in my experience, unparalleled at Harvard. Low stress yet extremely packed with information, this course really allows you to learn through doing. Results are not as stressed as process, and this makes for an even more fun and educational semester.","This was probably my favorite class I've taken at Harvard. Even though it's a big time commitment, I was always really excited to go to lab so it wasn't an issue at all. In general, it was really fun, and you learn so much. Also, the teaching staff is incredible! Highly, highly recommended.","Great course. Enables you to get really great lab experience in a creative, relaxed setting. The teaching staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, which makes every part of the class enjoyable and worthwhile.","One of the best courses I've taken so far at Harvard. If you're looking for a great introduction to chemistry research that finds a beautiful middle ground between giving you a good amount of freedom and the right amount of guidance, this is it! Course staff are extremely helpful, obviously care a great deal about the course and its students, and are there to answer any questions you might have. I can point to this class as one of the single classes that made me most excited about science and research at Harvard."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 101: Organic Synthesis Towards a Genomic Medicine,This class gave a great overview of the many methods currently used to do research at the interface of organic chemistry and genetics.,This is an interesting class that will greatly improve your scientific writing,I would highly recommend this course - it offers a platform in which you learn to generate new ideas and decide how you're going to test those ideas experimentally.,"Take this class with an open mind, be prepared to read A LOT, and get ready to think hard about grant proposals. Strong background in either biology or synthetic chemistry (or both) is probably best. You need a knowledge base in at least one of these to succeed and be prepared to branch out into areas of weakness.","If you are interested in pursuing research, this is an excellent course to take. Do not underestimate the grants though. They are very, very difficult to write. However, the course overall is very manageable and actually very interesting. I would certainly recommend other Chemistry concentrators take this course.","If you're interested in any intersection of chemistry and biology and want to be exposed to the cutting edge of what's out there in biomedical and genomic medicine research, this class is a must take. The lack of busy work is very refreshing and while the 3 R01 proposals are a substantial amount of work, you get something out of it and practice your abilities to create real and feasible research proposals, which few other classes will truly expose you to.",Work hard on your proposals!  They make your experience in the course much more fulfilling and give you the chance to be creative.  This class allows you to take risks.,It's really what you want it to be.,"This is a great class for anybody who is interested in using organic chemistry to benefit human health.  It covers a very broad range of topics from natural product total synthesis to histone biochemistry to cancer biology, which gives students an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature and incredible breadth of modern chemical biology.  The structure of the course allows you to focus on whatever interests you the most, which is good in some regards, but bad in others.  Listening to Prof. Schreiber talk about science, however, is always a treat and I always looked forward to lecture.","Like all of the other responses probably say, the proposals are massive and will take way more time than you expect. Get started on them super early. Also, you really shouldn't take this class unless you have a good amount of lab/research experience. I only took the required Orgo and Chem and felt behind compared to the graduate students that mostly comprise the class.",Make sure to spend a lot of time working on your proposals. Coming up with good ideas on your mini-proposals is essential.,"This is one of those classes where you don't really learn anything per se, but are responsible for picking a couple of things you're interested in and following up on them.  There's two proposals you'll have to write and those will basically be all-nighters, but aside from that there isn't too much work for the class.  But if you have any interest in going into research, learning how to structure and write up a proposal is a great thing to learn.","Take Chem 101!!! You will learn so much from the lectures, and with the broad array of topics covered, there is bound to be something that you will find very interesting. You learn a lot from the grant proposals that you write -- this is the main assignment in the course -- and you get great feedback that will help you think about and write about your own ideas in the future.",It's a great graduate class! I learnt a lot about current research in chemical biology and really improved my research proposal writing skills.,The class is enjoyable and rarely stressful.,This course is super stressful right before the big proposals so give yourself plenty of time to work on them.,"Highly recommend this class if you are interested in learning about how chemistry and biology can come together to address disease. There are no exams, so that is nice, but the proposals do take quite a bit of time to complete and should not be put off until the last moment. If proper planning is put into the proposals (and the discussion section helps with this a lot), then the proposals are great for learning how to be comfortable writing a NIH style research proposal.","Be aware that most students in the class are grad students. I essentially did nothing for the class each week, but then spent like 15 hours writing each of my essays (they're really hard to write if you don't go to lecture or have much background in genome stuff, but it's doable), and my grades were good."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 106: Advanced Organic Chemistry,"For undergrads mostly:  You should have a genuine interest in Chemistry and not be too fazed by not understanding things. There were a lot of things I think I still haven't really grasped, but I appreciate having been introduced to all those concepts.","If you approach this class the right way it will be very rewarding and you will learn a lot.  The two most important things are that you must motivate yourself to be interested in the subject matter and you must be very willing to ask Eugene for clarification on things you don't understand both in lecture and office hours.  You will get out as much as you put into this course, but you need to take some responsibility for your own learning."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 115: Advanced Organic Chemistry: Synthesis of Complex Molecules,"Even if you've seen synthesis before, you haven't seen it like this.","This is a challenging class, but very rewarding. If you are willing to put effort in to study the material, then you will get a lot out of the class.","This class is undoubtedly the most difficult class I have ever taken, but it was also one of the most rewarding.  Expect to spend 20+ hours per problem set, but struggling with these problems is the most effective way to become better at retrosynthetic analysis and planning asymmetric syntheses.  Prof. Myers is a great lecturer, but be prepared to be put on the spot during class.","It's important to know what you're trying to get out of this course before taking it. Unless you're interested in spending a large part of your life making small molecules, taking CHEM115 may just mean putting in a whole lot of effort to develop skills that you'll forget in a few months. But if you really want to understand organic synthetic chemistry as it's actually practiced, this course will prepare you about as well as you can hope for in a classroom setting. It's definitely a beast of a course, and you should be prepared to expend a lot of mental energy on problem sets and exams, but you will learn a lot over the course of this semester. Just make sure that you have a use for that knowledge -- as Myers says at the start of the semester, taking CHEM115 is similar to taking an upper-level foreign language course, and there aren't too many native speakers of organic synthesis.","Anyone who wants to learn about organic synthesis should definitely take this class, as long as they can commit a substantial amount of time to it.","It is one of the most difficult but most useful class you'll ever take, if you can make it all the way through. Only take it if you're committed to working hard.","This course is absolutely outstanding.  It is also hard.  That being said, as long as you are willing to commit time to it and work hard at it, you will be fine and you will learn an enormous amount of chemistry.  It was one of the best classes I've taken."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 145: Experimental Inorganic Chemistry,This was a great class and after taking it I feel much more comfortable in a lab setting.,Excellent overview of synthetic and spectroscopic techniques relevant to inorganic chemistry. Excellent commitment from instructors including focus on effectively communicating results.,"This is an amazing lab class. With only 4 students, you get to work one-on-one with the teaching staff; the lab-work is also very interesting to do and you will learn a lot of good techniques. This class also prepares you to make presentations (unlike others which end in a paper)."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 155: Advanced Inorganic Chemistry II,"This class forces you to become very comfortable with convoluted papers and helps you develop the framework to explain reactivity trends via MO theory.   It also forces you to improve your presentation skills.  The class would have been better if the readings, notes, and psets were more integrated.","This is a great class!! I took it after Chem 40, and liked this class much more than Chem 40. It's satisfying to use all the Chem 40 material to learn about the current research in inorganic chemistry. The lectures are pretty interesting, but not very related to the problem sets. The psets are pretty hard, but doable (lots of MOs). The final proposal is fun and not too difficult.","This is a very interesting investigation into how electronic structure of transition metals and ligand frameworks affect catalytic ability and so on. The class requires a lot of time, but the teaching staff are really helpful so you should be ok if you attend office hours.","Take this if you're interested in hardcore inorganic/organometallic chemistry. If you're only sort of interested, it is going to be too much work and detail for you.",This is a great class to get a feel for graduate level course work and to extend your knowledge in inorganic chemistry.  You are learning relevant information and it forces you to think creatively and critically as a chemist.,"Be prepared. If you put in the work to understand the material, and can relate that understanding to a group of peers, this course will go very well for you.",Read the papers in depth and before class.,"Never again will I tell someone inorganic chemistry is a bunch of general trends with an equal number of exceptions.

Ted teaches inorganic chemistry in a fundamentally different way than any other inorganic course I've ever taken. We began by learning how to predict electronic structure and then used this understanding to predict and rationalize reactivity. I found this a much more accessible way to approach problems in inorganic chemistry.

The emphasis on small molecule activation is fascinating as well. Using electronic structure as the basis for understanding how to solve these important world-wide problems was particuarly fun and engaging.","If you liked Chem 40, you'll like this course! It's basically an extension of the concepts learned in Chem 40 as applicable to the current literature. The workload is very manageable--4 psets that are somewhat lengthy but very reasonable and one proposal. No exams, which is super nice! Prof. Betley is great. I'd definitely recommend it as an upper-level chem elective!"
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 160: The Quantum World,"Have a solid background in programming, it'll make the class much more manageable. Go to office hours!","I understand that the teaching staff was trying very hard to make this a good course. But I honestly cannot give this class a good review, and it was a complete waste of my time. To be fair, this was the first iteration of a very new course structure, but it was nowhere close to working. If you are considering taking this course, please use the add/drop deadline to your advantage and see if the course has improved since I took it.

First, I want to talk about the lectures. Alan is a great and friendly guy, and very intelligent, but the lectures did not teach me anything. We were all given lecture notes to fill out with equations and follow along in class, but this was all we did: go through the lecture notes, page by page, and fill in the blanks with equations with no clue as to where these equations came from. 

The assignments are set up so that attendance at the lectures isn't even necessary to receive good grades. These problem sets were so easy that it was probably 10% the difficulty of any CS50 programming assignment. Furthermore, they required absolutely no knowledge of what was going on in class to complete. For instance, some problem sets would literally consist of blocks of code to fill out, and the instructions would tell you line by line what to do (""write a for loop and print this"", ""graph this""). I easily completed each problem set with no clue what was happening.

Sometimes, it was even worse: problem sets were distributed with numerous bugs, and often the code that was provided by the staff just plain crashed or didn't work. When this happened, fixes would be emailed to the class, sometimes very late in the week, right before the pset was due. I often got frustrated because my code wouldn't run simply because the boilerplate code didn't work. Assignments did not contribute to my learning at all. 

Here's a tip regarding how to choose classes: look carefully at the assignments. Make sure they are challenging enough that you can learn the more difficult concepts in class well by completing the psets. Make sure that they actually help you learn and don't consist of rote coding of for loops with no purpose in mind. This class was a disaster, partially because the assignments contributed absolutely nothing. 

If you are interested in quantum and you have room in your schedule for a challenging but fulfilling course, skip this class and take Physics 143a.","This is a great class for chemistry concentrators. They really focus on teaching you what you need to know about quantum as a chemist. Don't expect to really go in depth into the math and theory, there are other courses for that. Alan and his staff have crafted an amazing course for chemistry concentrators.","You will not learn quantum mechanics after taking this course.  You will in fact learn very little of the principles.   Nonetheless, you will learn python and get an intuition for how to take on quantum problems.  You will get a lay of the land--the bigger picture of quantum at the expensive of not comprehending the details.","This is a great class!! From what I've heard, chem 160 in previous years has been painless and hard to understand -- this is definitely not the case anymore! Alan and the rest of the teaching staff are wonderful. They are so clearly excited about the material and the students, which makes everything so much more enjoyable. The material is interesting and the class has a strong focus on how things are applied (especially with the coding psets) which is super cool and important! Work load is very low, and there are no exams. They really give you the freedom to decide what kinds of things you find interesting and to pursue those. That being said, it's easy to get by without really understanding the material, so make sure that doesn't happen to you!","-there exists a gap between the skills that is required to do problem sets and that required to understand the lecture. this means that you can do psets and quizzes without fully understanding the lecture, but doing so will fundamentally hurt you. i recommend that you try your best to grasp the materials taught in class.","How much you get out of the class is entirely dependent on how much work you put into the class. You can totally get through without knowing any actual course content, as long as you can finish the iPython exercises. Or you can spend hours laboring over the content, but have no difficult assessment or problem set to test your knowledge. It is extremely interesting material, and Alan and the TFs are super enthusiastic about helping you every step along the way. But you really have to have the self-motivation to learn the material, if you want to get anything out of the course.","You are exposed to methods used by contemporary quantum scientists, which is cool, but as always you get out what you put in.",Start on the considerable exercises early because office hours are necessary to do well on them.,"If Alan is teaching this, you should take it. I took this class having no idea what it was going to be like. I think it was one of the best decisions ever. It's essentially a coding class (Python), so if you have a lot of background with coding, you'll be fine. Otherwise, be wary. I'm not sure how much quantum I actually learned, 1)because it's hard but also 2) because of the structure of the course. No exams, just longer psets called ""considerable exercises."" Weekly online quizzes that have a ridiculous amount of extra credit. Only frustrating part is a lot of typos in the psets. Otherwise, a fantastic course--one where you can dabble in quantum while getting a good grade.","I took CHEM 160 instead of PS1/PS11 as a pre-med requirement and I'm extremely grateful for the decision. The class uses the edX platform which is really helpful for keeping track of all of the course materials including 5-10 minute instructional ""pencasts."" It presents a lot of material but you aren't required to learn all of it. You will get out however much you put in, however. A lot of the earlier programming exercises can be completed without learning any quantum chemistry. The staff is very approachable, and there is a lot of hand-holding through the exercises. Not having tests from this class really alleviates stress. The programming aspect is a huge plus and demystifies quantum chemistry when you can see every step take place in code.","The class was not too challenging and you gain an appreciation for how theoretical chemists and experimentalists could collaborate and work together. I would recommend you have some coding experience, but besides that there isn't a strong requirement for math/physics background. (In the future they probably should buff up on the Math/Physics to make the class more relevant but that day is not today). Also, make sure you're able to go to office hours to go over your code at least once a week.","Overall, the class was a lot of fun - at the beginning, the iPython component felt a bit like being thrown into the deep end, but I ended up feeling like I learned a lot of useful programming skills, and the programming exercises were a lot of fun. (Though, honestly, you could probably get through most of the programming assignments without completely understanding the course material.) The class sometimes felt a bit disorganized and/or overwhelming, though probably some of this could be chalked up to the fact that it was basically a new course this year, and overall the class was not a HUGE amount of work. Also, the teaching staff and Alan were fabulous - very helpful and accessible.","Alan and the teaching staff are fantastic people and you can tell they really care about you learning. It was a super chill course that allowed you to take what you wanted from it (e.g. you could either just coast through and be a code monkey or actually take the time to properly learn the concepts). With weekly psets and only two ""considerable exercises"" with no final, it's definitely not too time-intensive but I felt like it was more a class on coding (in python) than actually learning the theory of quantum chemistry. That was largely on me though because the materials are there to help you learn beyond just the code. Overall really solid course and after hearing from friends who took past versions of chem 160, it was definitely the most fun and least painful.","This is a required concentration course, even if you do not have a lot of interest in quantum chemistry. Fortunately, the coding assignments were all very easy and comparable to the in-class examples.","Very laid back class- onus is on the student to be self motivated if you want to learn anything, because most of what you learn you don't need to know in order to get a good grade.  If you're motivated, you will learn tons.","As taught by Alan this course was fantastic and not like any other science course I have ever taken. The class was very low stress and doesn't require a huge amount of time dedicated to it in order to get through with decent grades - however if you don't dedicate the time, you won't take away much because many of the assignments are able to be done without a real understanding of quantum mechanics. For the considerable exercises definitely start them before a week before they're due!! I didn't and it was a bit painful to cram them into a short period of time. The teaching staff for the course is extremely dedicated and nice - they seriously made the course as great as it was. Watching Alan lecture is always a fun experience, whether or not you actually know what he's talking about! He's just so passionate you can't help but feel that what he's talking about is cool. I'm not sure how this will be taught in the future, but I really enjoyed it (but would have enjoyed it more if I had actually dedicated the time to really knowing the material). I did definitely learn some things too even though I definitely didn't learn all the material!",I would definitely recommend this class but if you are a chem concentrator-- you have to take it anyways. The psets are all coding so if you are okay with that- than the class is not bad. The two midterms are also coding exercises and they give you a lot of time and guidance.,They changed the class entirely and it was awesome. If you like practical applications of quantum mechanics this is your course. You get to write code to implement all the stuff you learn and see how it really works.,Chem 160 teaches you how to code in ipython -- an incredibly valuable life skill -- and the teaching staff are so dedicated and excited about the course that it makes the whole experience fun and rewarding.,"This is a fun way to learn about quantum chemistry. You will also improve your skills at programming in ipython.  However, this will not give the rigorous, proof-based, pen-and-paper quantum mechanics education.",Programming skills are beneficial.,"I actually really ended up liking this course. My coding skills have gotten significantly better, along with my conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics. That being said, I did put in a lot of work outside of lecture by going to office hours every week. They were also fun to go to since the teaching staff and very friendly and helpful. Really, if you put in the work, you will get a good grade.","If you want to learn quantum you definitely can in this course. If you got stuck taking this because its a requirement and you really don't care about quantum, you'll still be fine. I got an A in this course and have no idea what I learned in any of the lectures. Don't think I could explain a single thing about quantum chemistry.But thats ok because you don't need to know it. A lot of the course is coding based so if you had no background (like me) go early in the course for help to learn the basics and you'll be fine. Takes some time, but nowhere near as difficult or time consuming as other courses I've taken at Harvard. Go to office hours as much as you can to get the coding psets done and start considerable exercises early. Really though, don't be afraid of this class.The TFs are great so use them!!!","Good, painless class. Not a great way to really learn quantum chemistry (if you want to understand the theory) but good for learning computational quantum chem.","This class teaches you all the basics and fundamentals of a very useful language, Python. The computational skills you take away from this class will be valuable many science fields."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 163: Frontiers in Biophysics,"Sunney is brilliant, but do not let his name and reputation in the scientific community convince you he is an adequate teacher.","If you choose and learn this course, you will never regret at the end."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 171: Biological Synthesis,"Wow, Prof. Balskus has crammed this course full of interesting material. There is so much cool chemistry presented, AND the exams and problem sets are perfectly fair in the way they hold you to that material. A truly well designed and taught class.","This class is a good introduction to an emerging, fascinating field, taught with a heavy reliance on primary literature. The first half of the class teaches common enzymatic mechanisms and active site analysis. Having taken 20/30 I felt like I got a lot out of this. The second half teaches engineering strategies and experimental design. It felt somewhat repetitive and not really worth the time spent. Prof. Balskus is an excellent lecturer; there are also a number of guest lectures which were hit and miss.","The first half is more suited to chemistry major/graduate students, while the second half is more suited to biochemistry/chemical biology majors/graduate students.","There is a good amount of work in this class, so if you are going to be busy this semester, I wouldn't take it.","This is a great class if you have an interest in going into research on biological synthesis or want to learn more about biochemistry from a chemists perspective. You'll also get a really good handle on how the pharmaceutical/biotech industries work. However, keep in mind the course is almost entirely graduate students, and a strong preparation (beyond just 1 year of organic chemistry) is probably needed to do well. Problem sets were interesting and manageable, the tests were really long and time-pressured (even for seasoned veterans).","This is a challenging and rewarding course. It is great because it is interdisciplinary. Highly recommended for any aspiring chemistry or biochem/mol bio student. You will learn a lot about the forefront of a currently evolving relevant field. It will give you a unique understanding of the enzymology, synthesis, metabolic engineering, genetics involved in natural product biosynthesis.",Take this class if you enjoy biology! Do not expect a chemistry only course even though it is a 100 level chemistry course! Also expect to be surrounded by graduate students!,It is a good course but may be challenging if you do not find the subject interesting.,"Every part of this class was enjoyable - engaging lectures, an interesting and valuable weekly section, problem sets that indicated exactly what skills we should be focusing on, and useful assignments.","This class is a lot of work! If you don't have a strong organic chemistry background, you are going to have to work really hard. Go to office hours as much as you can for the problem sets.","This class is structured in such a way that, for most people, I think it will fall in the ""good but not great"" category. ""Biological synthesis"" can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and that ultimately leads to an interdisciplinary course that doesn't quite commit to one perspective. The good side of that coin is that you'll be exposed to a pretty broad range of science, but because each of these subfields is so different, a) you're not going to get a very strong grounding in any one approach, and b) there'll probably be at least one unit that you just don't really enjoy. I personally would have been happy to trade the lectures about directed evolution for more insights into enzymatic physical organic chemistry, but I talked to plenty of people in the class who wanted just the opposite. All that being said, Emily is one of the best people I can think of to deliver an overview of this subject matter, since her research somehow manages to cover everything in this course. She's also incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgable, and she does a great job emphasizing the applications of her lectures -- the guest lectures were perfectly integrated into the curriculum and really quite interesting. I learned a lot in this course, although that knowledge is definitely of the broad (not so deep) variety.","If you are an organic chemist with little to no background in biological synthesis or biology in general, this is a great course. It will likely change your application of chemistry and give you ideas for new projects and interests to pursue. To all others note that knowledge of organic chemistry is definitely helpful in this class as it is relatively fast paced. Overall if you are willing to review your notes on a weekly basis and put in a good bit of time to study for the exams. This class is very manageable and rewarding. Psets are on the shorter side if you have taken the time to over course material.","If you like biological chemistry take this class, the material is super interesting.",Prof. Balskus definitely enthusiased me about research at the interface of microbiology and organic chemistry. The lectures were incredibly clear and I appreciated how we were encouraged to ask questions. Since taking the class I have been to three independent research seminars which would have been incomprehensible had I not been in the Chem 171 Class - I think this shows how useful and important this class is for anyone considering research in the chemical biology field!,This class is great for those who are interested in the subject material and that have the right background.,A solid class that gives a strong background in enzymology.,"Great class with a lot of really interesting material. It's a lot of work to keep up with everything covered in class. The first exam was a bit of a whirlwind in that it was challenging and long, and the exams in general required extreme comfort with the material if one is to get anywhere near finishing on time (they didn't leave that much time to think). I learned a LOT from the research proposal at the end of the semester, and loved that it was our final project.","If you are interested in the very specific field of using microbes and other organisms for directing the production of molecules, then this is the class for you! However, it is a very specific and focused class. If your interests are not in this area of research and you take this class as a program requirement, then this class is heavily time-consuming (long problem sets each week), difficult and not overly helpful in preparing you to tackle other research goals. Additionally, the length of each of the two exams was over 20 pages and did not allow for adequate time to think about an answer, but required you to begin immediately writing.",The course was well put together and not particularly difficult.  The first and second half of the course were fairly different with the first focusing more on biochemistry and metabolite synthesis and the second half focusing on metabolic engineering.,"overall good class. worth taking if you are interested in natural products but know that there is lots of outside work (6 problem sets, 1 news and views, and 1 proposal) plus two exams."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 190: Statistical Mechanics in Chemistry and Biology,"This class is a ton of fun, and the quality of teaching is quite high. CHEM 190 is well worth the challenge it presents!"
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 242: Quantum Mechanics for Physical Chemistry,"This is an introductory quantum mechanics course similar in scope to Physics 143a, though it assumes that you have previously taken a quantum mechanics course (e.g. Chem 160).  There is relatively little emphasis on ab initio calculations using Hartree-Fock or DFT methods; these topics were treated in two weeks at the end of the course. If you have a working knowledge of QM and want to learn about these topics, I would recommend reading Szabo & Ostlund (Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory) on your own.  In particular, if you are a physics undergrad you will find that much of the material is a repeat of Physics 143a.",Make sure you have more than the listed prereqs for quantum.,"This class is HORRIFICALLY BAD! Do NOT take it; you'll learn more in an upper-level physics class or any other computational chemistry class. There's a list of reasons: [1] The teaching was either mediocre or a complete waste of time, [2] the resources for learning outside of class were impossible to find, [3] the assignments varied wildly in difficulty (and some had both undergrads and graduate students alike struggling for 5-6 days), [4] the exam was horribly tedious, [5] both question-wording and due dates for assignments and projects were really unclear, [6] the TF (Lucas Kocia) was not helpful or instructive and sometimes even rude and discouraging, [7] grading was unbelievably harsh (simple errors sometimes yielding ZERO points, WITH propagation to subparts of the questions!), and so on. This description doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. If you want to learn something about Hartree-Fock, DFT, and modern chemistry/physics, please do so elsewhere, either through independent study or in another course. If you MUST take it, do yourself the favor of taking it Pass/Fail. You have been warned!"
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,CHEM 301hf: Scientific Teaching and Communications:  Practicum,It's useful to practice before starting the real teaching.,"This class gets students to talk about science in front of a class, which is an important first step in developing sound teaching skills.  What you get out of this class will be directly proportional to what you put into it.","It's certainly easy to put minimal effort in this class, but I suggest that you don't – this is a great way to improve your teaching in a low-key environment, so definitely use it! You can definitely put effort in without it being too stressful. It's also nice to see everyone in your cohort regularly :)",It's a great way to get an introduction to how to be a good teacher (from some of the best teachers around) before getting started with teaching yourself.,Chemistry 301 is an introduction to becoming a teaching fellow at Harvard.  The class offers opportunities to become comfortable teaching by practicing in a relaxed environment with fellow chemistry graduate students.,"Good for students who have no experience in teaching, but boring and redundant for those with any experience.",be open! and confident!
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,LPS A: Foundational Chemistry and Biology,I would tell future students to take full advantage of both instructor and TF office hours. The professors genuinely want everyone to succeed and are genuine in answering students' questions. They're also readily available by email. The teaching staff genuinely feels like a team and it's worth developing a relationship with them. I would also tell students to do the practice problems for both the chemistry and biology portions of the class because they're applicable to material covered on both the problem sets and the exams.,"This class is what you make of it. It can be difficult and very fast-paced at times, but you can get a lot out of it if you put the time and effort into it and take advantage of all of the help available to you outside of the class. If you keep up with the work and readings and study every once in a while on your own to make sure you are really understanding the concepts, you will do fine.","I thought this was an overall great class! The lectures were easy to follow, the exams were fair, and the professors are so enthusiastic about what they teach. You will come out of this class with a good foundation for both chemistry and biology.",Keep reviewing material from the beginning of the course throughout the second half of the semester.,It is a huge time commitment. I found meeting 8 hours a week to be draining.,That Dr. Tucci is reason enough to take this class.,"This is a solid course to get your feet wet in biology and chemistry. At times the course is more engaging than others, but overall it was a positive experience for me in my freshman fall.","If you are the kind of student that struggles in science or math, you need to be able to set aside a lot of your time to go to office hours. The instructors will help you as much as they can in office hours and you will feel a lot better. If you have a strong background in science or math, you should be able to do very well in this class if you spend a few hours every week going over the materials you learned.","Even though it doesn't require any previous courses, a knowledge of AP Chem and AP Bio is very helpful. The pace is fast. LS1a covered much less material and had no midterms, while LPSa went through all of AP Bio and AP chem in one semester with 3 midterms and a final.","This course requires quite a bit of effort and time.  For me, the chemistry portion of the class was particularly difficult, and the exams were very disappointing.",Do the reading,"Do not assume it is an easier class than LS1A, it has a different approach.","Overall, I loved this course! Dr. Tucci is an amazing, and the entire teaching staff is always accessible. The exams were very fair, and there was always help for anyone who needed it, including teaching staff office hours, TF office hours, problem solving review sessions, and practice problem sessions. It was a great course that I would strongly recommend anyone to take!","Gregg Tucci is an amazing professor, and you get a very rounded overview of chemistry and biology concepts.",Great class. well organized and makes sense.,This class is worth every minute.  The teaching staff is great and always willing to help.  The class will take time and is difficult but the amount of knowledge you gain is worth it.  This is a great class to start off with if you are interested in science.,"They expect a lot from you. I had something for this class, lecture, lab, or section, every day of the week.","Although this course is supposedly easier than LS1A, I still found it to be appropriately challenging. Lectures with Gregg Tucci are engaging and enjoyable to attend. While Tamara Brenner is a competent lecturer, I found her to be less inspiring, and I attended fewer of the biology lectures as a result. I found that it wasn't necessary to attend every lecture as long as I kept up with the notes and went to section. The problem solving review sessions were usually unnecessary unless I felt I needed extra help with the material. Overall, this course is a good choice and allows you to choose your own level of participation. The workload is manageable, and I would recommend this course to anyone considering LPSA or LS1A.","LPSA does not necessarily cover less material than LS1A, but is more structured in that the chemistry and biology are presented separately and problems are straight forward. However, it would be beneficial to have a decent knowledge of chemistry and biology before taking this. Also, the biology part is very dry and is hard to pay attention to.","This class is not difficult, provided you stay on top of your work, since the material tends to build on itself. The course instructors are all excellent people, and I think anybody would enjoy taking LPS A.","if you go to office hours for help with p-sets, you'll do great",A background in chemistry and biology would be very helpful.,"Take advantage of all of the resources that this class offers, including practice exams, lecture videos, review lectures, help rooms, office hours, and guided problem solving. This class is what you make of it.","TAKE THIS COURSE OVER LS1A. BUT, do not get fooled and believe that this is ""easy"". This class will lead to many late nights and unless you have a group of friends to do psets with or study with you will not like this class, let alone survive. Please try it if you're pre-med and use it to judge whether you want to continue as a pre-med. It will challenge you but ask for help! WHATEVER YOU DO, ASK FOR HELP. HINKLE IS BAEE!!","This class is good for learning the fundamental concepts behind chemistry and biology, but make sure you stay caught up with the work and learning in order to stay on top of things.","If you are worried about your Bio or Chem background, take this class. They go back to basics and build from there so you'll really understand. Also Dr. Tucci is an amazing lecturer.",I would say take ls1a.,This is a good class and easy to do well in if you go to lecture and go to section. Biology portion of the lecture can be a bit of a bore sometimes but chemistry lectures are definitely quite interesting.,"If you're not willing to put in extra work outside of class, don't take this class.","This class will go quickly if you haven't got any chemistry background. Make sure to keep up, ask for help, and do all of the practice problems for each week. I took AP chemistry, but I struggled in it, and I feel like taking LPSA clarified everything I wasn't entirely sure how to figure out. The chemistry side of the course is much more intensive than the biology.","It's a good class. Be prepared to put in work for the p-sets. The bio section is harder than the chem section for most people. Don't think it's an easy A, but you can easily get an A as long as you put in work.",Take this class over LS 1a,"LPSA will give you a solid foundation in biology and chemistry. The course staff is completely committed to making sure you are successful in the class. Make sure you put in hours on your part as well. Most of what I learned, I got from the psets and practice problems, so put in the time with those.","Stay on top of your work, go to the guided problem solving reviews, do every single practice problem.","It's harder than LS 1a, so proceed with caution. The entire teaching staff is amazing and is so helpful. You will actually need their help in the course because it is so difficult! If you are stuck between LS 1a and this class DO NOT use your placement as your only reason for taking this class. Talk to the professors, look at the class materials, and use the Q guide. Be prepared for a TON of work. You WILL need to manage your time like Ebenezer Scrooge manages his money, so watch out.",Great intro course,"This course is easy to do well in if you put the work in. Don't underestimate the power of studying for the exams. You will do well on the psets, but if you don't study for the exams they won't go... as well as you would hope. Overall, this course is relatively straightforward and interesting. The lab component is well run and fun.",LPS-a is a fun with a great teaching staff. The lectures are fun and the material is presented clearly. Labs are interesting and not too long. The material is interesting and straightforward. A great introduction.,"Would take over LS1a. More structured, and more class time to allow for better understanding.",This is truly a wonderful class. The professors are helpful and enthusiastic about the course material and there are so many resources to help you succeed.,"The teaching staff is extremely helpful and genuine. If you do not like science then I would not recommend, but if you have any interest in the sciences then I would be sure to recommend.",Very demanding course,"Do the practice problems before doing the problem sets it will help you learn the concepts better. Also, starting preparing for the exams will in advance because they cover substantial material and none of the class is curved.",If you do everything that is expected (practice problems included) and go to the reviews and office hours with your questions you will be fine.,"It's a class you have to take if you're Premed.. with the new revamp, I suggest taking LS1a but the teaching staff is absolutely amazing and the class is very structured.",This class is an easy class that you learn a lot in.  They walk you through everything clearly.  The chem part is better than the bio part.,"The chemistry portion of the course is difficult if you have no prior knowledge of physics, but the material is well taught. Professor Tucci is an amazing professor and I would really recommend taking one of his classes.","This class is exactly what it is presented to be. There are no tricks or gimmicks, all the information given about the course is true. Problem sets and tests are fair, they only cover material that was touched on during lecture or section. The resources available to help students succeed in this course are unsurpassed; the teaching staff is extremely accessible. Overall this was a great class, not easy by any means, but I learned a lot.","There is as much help as you can possibly need, and the instructors are so nice and so helpful.","Only take this class if you absolutely have no background in either chemistry or biology. Otherwise, LS1A is probably a more appropriate class.",This course is extremely fast paced so stay on top of your work!,Do yourself a favor and take LS1a. The midterm system is ineffective and is designed to keep too many students from getting an A. LS1a is equivalent and a majority of people get A's there.,It's a good class. You'll learn a lot. Sometimes it feels kind of tedious or boring.,"LPS A is a great intro-level integrated biology/chemistry course. The emphasis on chemistry for the first half of the semester proves invaluable in the second half, when you will be asked to use those chemical properties in understanding and explaining biological processes. Overall, a well-taught course that pulls together both subjects in a meaningful way while also providing a solid base in each individual subject.","Take the class.  When you do, study for the exams by taking all the practice exams without looking at the answers.  You win.",LPSA is a good way to learn the basics of chemistry and biology and have a solid foundation for future science classes. The problem sets were manageable and the exams were not bad if you study.,Recommend to people very interested and pretty good at science,"Way easier than LS1A but hard to get up at 9am for. Luckily lectures are videotaped and notes are posted online, but its bad to become too reliant on these.","Dr. Tucci and Dr. Brenner are amazing. I really liked the layout of the course as far as the pset assignments, weekly review sessions, and sections are concerned. My friends in LS1a seemed to dislike the psets, but I found the LPSa psets relatively easy, shorter (since there's one a week vs. one every two weeks), and more helpful.","- great class
- for beginners and intermediates
- simply requires a bit of preparation and interest","Check and see how LS 1a is formatted. This year LS 1a was the course to take, not LPS A. I would also tell them that this course is a good course, but be aware of the ridiculously early 9 am lecture time. It was a huge turn-off.",This course is very comparable to LS1A and I would take LS1A over this. There is less class time in LS1A and the ICEs make it more manageable.,"If you have to take it for pre-med, take it.",Great intro class! Couldn't really imagine it being laid out any better.,hard and requires a lot of dedication to succeed,"There are a lot of resources available and if you understand the psets, practice problems, and lectures, you will do fine in the course! Very well structured and the work load is pretty constant.","TAKE LS1A! It was hard to have tests count so much for your grade and I feel the small quizzes that LS1A did better prepared students along the way. Although, LPSA probably prepared me better for what a real science course at Harvard would be like.","This is a wonderful class. I had a strong Chem background and was very comfortable the first half of the class. My biology background was very week which is why I chose this class over LS1a, I had to work a lot more the second part of the class but it was entirely manageable. 

You have so many resources including help rooms, practice problems, office hours, guided problem solving, problem solving lectures... The professors and teaching staff really want to see you succeed and learn the materiel and are very helpful.

I loved how enthusiastic the two professors are and how much they enjoy teaching, they even make an effort to learn everyone's names!","I would not recommend this course because there was so much work for this course. The Psets seemed like busy work and the class was not rewarding because the exams were so hard, so no matter how much I studied, I still felt like I did horrible on the exams.",It is a fun and practical way to fulfill a gen ed requirement. Great intro class for students interested in going into life sciences.,"Great class, learn more and better prepared than with LS1a",It gets harder with time. Be sure to do the practice problems and turn in the problem sets on time.,"LPSA is well-structured, but there are a TON of assignments (12), labs (9), and exams (3 midterms and 1 final). The chem portion of the class was great and super easy since I have already taken thermodynamics and a quantum/crystalography class. However, the biology portion is really dry and confusing. It's hard to make the switch between the 2 subjects. The exams are reasonable as long as you keep up with the assignments and course material. The labs were unnecessarily long and tedious. Overall, I definitely learned some stuff, but I'm not sure if it was worth the time. However, I had to take this class to get an SLS gen ed.",This course is extremely well taught and makes learning chemistry fun!,"This class is a really good class to take if you want to go into science but didn't take AP Chem in high school. It definitely isn't an easy class, but everything you need to succeed is given to you by the professors/ teaching staff, it's just a matter of finding the time to do all the optional work that is key to doing well in the class.","LPSA is such a fun class! It does require a lot of class time during the week and the midterms require a lot of studying, but the course heads and TFs provide so much help and review sessions that you are never alone. The lectures have a fun, relaxed atmosphere.","Despite this being an intro course, you definitely need a chem and bio background to succeed in this course.","This is one of the best structured classes. I have learned so much in a surprisingly short amount of time. It is a great way for those who feel that they do not have a solid chemistry or biology background to build that up. It is a lot of information, however. If you are willing to take advantage of the resources given to you, such as office hours, review sessions, sections, you will succeed in this class.",Interesting material but a lot of class time.,"Go to the lectures, even though they are at 9am and online, the lectures make all the difference.","The course covered a lot of material that will probably be useful in higher biology and chemistry courses, and it was at times engaging (with Tucci lecturing).  However, I have a lot of complaints. I think the biology portion should be retooled. The lectures for that portion don't seem to relate to the p-sets and exams, in that the lectures are quite basic, and then there is a huge leap in knowledge and application for the problems. I also found the practice exams were also always much easier than the actual exams, which I found disingenuous. You definitely need to have taken AP Chemistry and AP Biology. The course moves really fast, and if you've only had basic science you'll be struggling and behind everyone else who had more high school preparation.  Take it because you have to, but don't expect to enjoy it.","TAKE IT IF YOU MUST. If you have taken AP Biology and AP chemistry in high school, you won't learn anything new, but the information and the exams will be presented in a way that even if you already know the material well, you will only do well if you learn the material in the way that THEY teach it. It's an odd course. Also, 9AM lectures suck, and they are recorded, so halfway through the semester I just couldn't get myself to go to lecture anymore (and I'm not one to miss class a lot). Part of the reason I stopped going to lecture was because of Tamara Brenner's lecturing style. It is difficult to stay focused for an hour as opposed to when Tucci lectures, which is very interesting. Labs are fun and easy and I met cool people in my lab. Good luck","This class is good for anyone who wants to take an introductory science class.  It encompasses a lot of material, yet it is somewhat easier than LS1a.  Dr. Tucci is the bomb and is amazing, making me enjoy chem which I did not think was possible.  I wouldn't take this solely for the SLS GenEd, but if you are interested in taking higher-level science classes, this is the class to take for the introductory level.","The teaching staff is amazing - they are friendly, willing to help, and accessible. They really know how to prepare students. The course is split in two - chemistry in the first half, biology in the second half. The course has lecture three times are week, taught by the professors. Then there are sections taught by TFs throughout the week to apply what you learned in lecture. On Friday there is a review section taught by the preceptors. There is a lab section one day a week, almost every week. There are lots of office hours to get help, and the teaching staff are really responsive.",You'll love Dr.Tucci. Dr.Brenner is a toss up.,In general lectures were easy to follow and material was easy to understand. Problem sets were not very hard. Exams increased with difficulty as the semester went on. Exams often contained difficult application questions.,"This class was a great intro into chemistry and biology. The lectures are great and the fact that the lecture notes are given and also put online is extremely helpful. The labs are fun and help you understand the material. Overall, a great class especially if you haven't had too much background in either chemistry or biology.","From what I've now heard about the LS1A overhaul, students would have a more manageable time taking LS1A.",Keep up with the practice problems and try to go over lecture notes on a weekly basis and compile study guides for exams. Then create a cumulative study guide for the final.,I would tell students that they must take the time to learn the material well and not wait until the last minute to do assignments and study.,"It's a very well run, simple chem/bio course. Lab is not bad at all. Dr. Tucci, Brenner and Hinkle are all great. Casey is not the nicest person. I would take it as a gen ed if you have any interest in life sciences and want a really easy course.",Take advantage of the help network that is in place--it is extensive and very helpful.,"This class is pretty solid. If you have a good background in biology and chemistry, it will be pretty easy and a review of the material you learned in AP high school classes. Dr. Tucci is an awesome lecturer and keeps the class interesting as well.","Gregg is amazing, Brenner is alright. I went into this course with a strong background in Chem and a weak background in bio, so I basically glided with no effort for the first half of the semester and then had to work a little in the second half.",Have your Chemistry on point before you come to this class. It is by no means easy like they try to convince you. Be prepared to struggle,i struggled in the class,This class helps one build a solid foundation in the science fields as well as learning important life lessons such as time management.,If you are considering pre-med definitely take this class. It also fills a lot of different science concentration requirements.  It is very laid back and all the instructors of the course want to help you.,Best way to get my concentration requirement for basic chem and bio done. Tucci is a charismatic lecturer.,Great teaching! Not hard at all!,"Better taught and more fun that LS1a, highly recommended, Tucci makes it very enjoyable.",It is a good way to determine if you want to pursue Biology and Chemistry-related careers.,Don't take it unless you are going into the sciences.,If you're deciding between this and LS1A and have took AP Bio/Chem in hs just go with LS1A. I think they've made ls1a much more straightforward and less stressful than LPSA with their quizzes instead of midterms.,This course was a great introduction to chemistry and biology. The professors make the material very understandable in lecture especially by providing printed copies of the lecture slides to take notes on. They are also very accessible in office hours and try to learn the name of many of the students despite the fact that there are hundreds of students.,It's a manageable and enjoyable class.  I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy science and plan to do something related to science in the future.,"Utilize the large staff and support that is offered in this class. The material gets hard pretty quickly, so you have to be prepared for more difficult assignments.","This is a great introductory class and if you are given countless opportunities to ask for help in office hours or help sessions!!! You can easily email your TF, or even Dr. Tucci and they'll back to you almost immediately. Work in groups to do psets and you'll do great on them. Make sure you do practice problems and practice tests and you'll be fine on tests."
Chemistry and Chemical Biology,PHYSCI 10: Quantum and Statistical Foundations of Chemistry,Take this class. It's tricky but so interesting and so so worth it.,"A very useful introduction to quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics that is well-suited for advanced freshmen or other underclassmen. I would recommend this as a lead in to the new Python-based Chem 160 under Aspuru-Guzik if you have time. For upperclassman CPB concentrators, this could be a viable Chem 160 alternative (I chose this to avoid being in what would have effectively been 160’s first year), but it does require a familiarity with differential equations and calculus that might be quite rusty by junior / senior year, especially if you haven’t taken any math since freshman year.","I loved the course overall, and Adam is very good at explaining things.  The only bad part was the final project: it was stressful and difficult.",Great class - kudos to Professor Cohen,"If you are looking for an easy class, this is not the class for you. If you are, however, looking for a class that questions how you view science and the quantum mechanical properties that make everything possible, this is the perfect class for you! Get ready to work hard and spend time at office hours, but get ready for a rewarding experience that I proudly call my favorite class this semester.","Loved learning all the foundations of the formulas and concepts I learned high school AP chemistry. The biggest strength of PS10 was its teaching staff--Adam is great, and Lu and Amymarie are fantastic resources. They really care about you and help you prepare for exams!",This class requires a lot of work and is much different that high school chemistry.,"I loved PS10 and I would definitely recommend it if Adam and Lu are teaching next year. Although the class is very hard and moves very fast (whirlwind survey of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics!), there is so much support that it is not difficult to keep up provided you are willing to work hard.
The final project is also an amazing experience.","This class is very difficult but the teaching staff and material are absolutely great. If you are interested in this subject matter, the teaching staff does a great job applying what we learn in class to a lot of different applications. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this course (even if you are a bio/life sciences concentrator) because it is a great way to learn some foundational physical sciences. Overall, positives: subject material, teaching staff***, applications. Negatives; difficulty.","The teaching staff for this class is absolutely fantastic - they are all so helpful, personable, and open. There is a strong community relationship in the class, especially between freshmen. The class is challenging - very, very challenging. It was at times a rough adjustment from high school, but I learned so much and am so thankful for the relationships I made through the course.","If you have an interest in science but don't know how it relates to the rest of the scientific disciplines, take this course. I am a physics major, and so many of the things I learned up until this class seemed to be of little relevance to the real world because the situations were so specific and contrived","If you are looking forward to a good introduction for college Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics, this is a very great class. Adam is an amazing lecturer and we learn a lot of concepts; at the end of the year, he will remind you of the topics you learned and you will be pleasantly surprised. The TFs are very helpful and they will literally help you with EVERYTHING so if you have questions, feel free to ask them and they will gladly help you out. The tests may be a bit rough, but I've gotten so much out of this course. If you need an interesting general chemistry (and somewhat challenging for those who are less math/physics inclined), then this class is for you. Do not be intimidated though; some background in chemistry and physics with single variable calculus is all you need! Also, we make ice cream with liquid nitrogen at the end of the year, along with the luncheon for final project; how great is that?","This is a very time-consuming course, but can be rewarding if you are willing to put the effort into it. The material is very challenging, and be prepared for a lot more math than what you would expect from a chemistry class. Deriving formulas and theories is often frustrating and slow, but the application at the end is usually interesting. Don't let yourself fall behind in the material. Definitely seek out Lu's help if you take this course! She is a life saver.","The class is very difficult and a lot of work, but it is definitely worth it. You can always get help, and all members of the teaching staff are super accessible.","This course is wonderful! Every teaching staff so enthusiastic, and they truly want to help you every step of the way. I have to say that it is a very difficult chemistry course because nobody has seen any of the material from a high school background (mostly quantum mechanics). The tests are extremely hard as well. However, the satisfaction you get once you mastered the material is priceless.","This is a great class! All the teaching staff are extremely supportive and helpful. It's not an easy one though, and if you put a lot in, you will get a lot out. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend.",This class is a bast if you are really interesting in engaging in depth with quantum mechanics and the workings that govern the minuscule as well as large. This class though is not a walk and the park and with require lots of preparation within fields that are likely to be hard to grasp since the object of study is too small to ever see. The class though is a lot of fun with many in-class displays of science.,"This course, although quite challenging, is very rewarding in the end. Especially, at the symposium for final projects, as you truly realized how much you have learned over the span of the course.","If you don't mind working hard and putting in a lot of time, then this class is really rewarding.  You learn SO much and it exposes you to a lot of different aspects of chemistry.  This was my hardest class, but my favorite class.",It is very worthwhile and very challenging. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is genuinely interested in the material and willing to work hard to comprehend it.,"This is the best course I have taken at Harvard so far–I really have nothing but high praises for the teaching staff and the material. To begin, the material covered in this class strikes a fantastic balance between mathematical thinking and conceptual discussions. My mind was blown several times throughout the course as we discussed quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and honestly the way I view chemistry (from atoms to reactions) is forever altered in the most pleasant way. And this evaluation would not be complete without mentioning the ridiculously fantastic teaching staff. Professor Cohen is THE BEST–his office hours were the highlight of the semester, I mean you get to ask all these weird questions about quantum mechanics that you've always wondered about and he will explain things to you clearly and satisfactorily, it's the best thing ever. Not to mention the remarkable Lu Wang and Amymarie, who are extremely approachable and devoted to the class. (How many TFs answer your questions sent late at night within 10 minutes?) 

In summary, take this course. It's sufficiently challenging but certainly doable, and just worth it.",The material for this class is fascinating and not exceedingly difficult.  Study for midterms and you will do well.,"This course has the best, most understanding, most helpful teaching staff of any class I've taken. The professor, preceptor, and TFs are so accessible, and it's clear they want to help you succeed. PS10 is more difficult than other typical pre-med courses, but it's worth it to know that you're not wasting your time and that you're learning something new that is worthwhile, especially if you're considering concentrating in any chemistry-related field. This is also the most fair and reasonable course I've taken. There are no problem sets or labs the weeks of exams, and the staff holds plenty of extra office hours the weekends before exams so that you have lots of opportunities to ask questions and review. For the final project, you are assigned to an adviser (a member of the staff) that is dedicated to your success, and you are also welcome to ask other members of the staff for guidance. In general, this is an amazing class that I guarantee you will not regret taking. It might seem difficult in your first week, depending on your background, but stick with it at least through the first test and watch yourself grow as a student among some of the nicest, most helpful faculty Harvard has to offer."
Comparative Literature,COMPLIT 249: Cartography and Early Modern Literature,It's a very good course that can give you a lot of information on many literary texts from a very original perspective.
Comparative Literature,COMPLIT 270: Urban Imaginary and Visual Culture,"The readings are hard. You will not get everything, but it is still worth it."
Comparative Literature,COMPLIT 275: Theory of Narrative: Conference Course,"Great readings, brilliant classmates. The professor is kind, rigorous, and entertaining. You won't waste your time if you enroll here. 

My one criticism is that I wish William Todd had made use of the blog feature on his isite. I suspect it could have made class discussions a lot more interesting. Every week we'd come to class and you'd have the same handful of people talking about the readings, plus whoever presented their oral report on the reading for the week. Everyone else would remain quiet. I think this is partly because the class time, even though it was two hours long, really only allowed for a few people to talk, and because it was pretty big for a seminar, some individuals were more shy. If there had been a weekly online blog post assignment, there would have been more opportunity for everyone to contribute to discourse about the texts and theories we examined.","A wonderful, wonderful reading list that will introduce you to the best thinkers and writers in theory. Professor Todd does a great job of orienting everyone to the texts (with an undertone of playful humor!) and has an excellent sense of how complex ideas fit together into a coherent if combative intellectual story. The presentation structure (1-2 students present on texts every day) means much of the discussion is student led and initiated, so if your classmates fall through on that day, you could miss the exegesis of your favorite text--that's unfortunate. But the ownership and knowledge you gain by doing your own presentation should make up for it, depending on how you feel about preparing it. Definitely a better course for self-starters who want to do serious reading and come in with questions that will drive the discussion in a way they prefer. Hanging along passively, while certainly possible, may leave you unsatisfied at the end, since you won't have a comprehensive survey of each reading in class. That you'll have to do on your own."
Comparative Literature,"COMPLIT 299ar: What is Comparative Literature?: Pasts, Presents, and Futures: Proseminar"
Comparative Literature,LITER 96: Grounds for Comparison,"Lit 96 offers a great introduction to the field of Comparative Literature. Taught as a small seminar, the course covers global literatures from several different time periods and regions of the world. Each week has a central theme and focuses on several primary texts and secondary pieces of criticism. The reading list— generally excerpts or short texts—is, however, very manageable, so it is very possible to complete all the readings in great detail. 

Professor Damrosch also leads effective seminars, balancing student discussions and his suggestions about the texts. The topics are fascinating and often related to issues in philosophy, politics, and cultural studies. In addition, Professor Damrosch is very approachable for help with assignments or questions about readings or the course in general. Compared to many introductory or survey courses in literature, this is one of the more accessible courses—even to those concentrating in non-humanities fields—so if comparative literature is of any interest, I suggest taking this course as it is compelling, comprehensible, and reasonable in its workload.","This class is low-stress.  Professor Damrosch obviously loves what he's teaching, and he includes materials you wouldn't get in a more conventional literature course.  He gives a good survey of the comparative aspect of comparative literature, bringing texts from very different backgrounds and putting them side by side.",This course is a great introduction to literary theory and is perfect for anyone thinking about concentrating in literature. I would definitely recommend it!,"A breathtaking romp across the continents, between the genres, and through the millennia. You’ll read Derrida, Bob Marley, Kalidasa, and others under the tutelage of a Professor who is more magician than pedant—a brilliant reader who manages to be as entertaining as he is instructive, and who prefers to guide the readings of the class rather than impose his own, explicitly or implicitly."
Comparative Literature,"LITER 121: From the 1001 Nights to the Arabian Nights : Adaptation, Transformation, Translation","Of all the classes I have taken in the comp lit department, this was my favorite. Dr. Naddaff is just an amazing professor, and I highly recommend that everyone take a class with her.","TAKE THIS CLASS! Prof. Naddaff is awesome. There's so much cool material to read and look at (art, music, DISNEY'S ALADDIN), and there's always so much to talk about, it's really a very thought-provoking environment. I took it as an english major looking for a seminar requirement and it went beyond my expectations. Granted, the whole class is reading, a LOT of reading, but it's all really riveting stuff. The stories are designed to make you want to keep reading! So, TAKE THIS CLASS!"
Comparative Literature,LITER 138: Subversive Renaissance: Books that Changed the World,"This was a well-structured class that helped me both learn about the Renaissance and change my previous assumptions about it. In Piechocki you will find a very kind, caring, and energetic professor.","The only reason I wouldn't want to recommend with enthusiasm might be because I'd like to preserve the small class size (a large part why I found this course so valuable). I'd say: if just a couple readings on the syllabus interest you, you are likely to enjoy the others as well, because the class encourages discussion of larger themes present in all readings."
Comparative Literature,LITER 146: Space and Place: The Environment in Film
Comparative Literature,"LITER 147: ""Why the Jews?"": The Modern Jewish Experience in Literature",Not just a class for Jews! The books are really good and Professor Horn is great.,"This is a really neat class to take, and it explores Judaism from a lot of different, often unconventional perspectives. Even someone who grew up surrounded by Jewish culture and/or practice should take this. Awesome class.","The course was quite challenging for someone without an English or Literature background. While I truly enjoyed the material, I found the writing assignments difficult. Professor Horn was accessible to provide significant feedback on drafts, but the questions and analysis were harder than what I was expecting. I really walked away from the course with an understanding of Jewish literature and the context in which it was written, but aside from the readings I spent a significant amount of time writing each paper and trying to understand the various themes being discussed.",before taking this course make sure have an understanding of Jewish historical events,"This was an excellent class! I thoroughly enjoyed the readings and discussions. Prof. Horn was a phenomenal instructor, and it was a real treat to have a seminar dynamic."
Comparative Literature,LITER 148:  Crisis: Twentieth-Century European Novels,"Existence aims for crisis from birth onwards: for further instructions, take this class.","Class discussions will focus primarily on literary styles and techniques. For a class about the social implications of pieces of fiction, I would recommend looking into the History and Literature department.","The works covered in this class are spectacular. Since the focus of the class is the discussion section, it will of course vary from year to year. Based on my experience, I would recommend this course to anybody, even non-concentrators."
Comparative Literature,LITER 149: Writing the World: Literature and Its Theories,"This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.  Professor Ungureanu is so enthusiastic about the material--it's infectious.  She makes you feel like you're learning something of great import, and you want to do the reading because she chose great texts and because you want to be able to participate to your fullest.  She's happy to help you during the essay process.  She's also infinitely understanding.  Every course she recaps everyone's blog postings, making sure to show how different people thought of the literature differently in order to ignite a conversation.  Take this class!","Delia is an EXCELLENT professor. She's enthusiastic, cares about her students, and has some really fantastic ideas. I also LOVED the books we had to read. This is what a class should feel like – you look forward to each lesson, and homework feels like pleasure reading.","You will learn the most if you read and make an effort to understand and form opinions about all of the texts for each week. This course will affect the way you read, and it will invite you to both revisit some of your favorite texts and read new ones with a keener, more profound eye."
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 114: Practical Aesthetics,The class is super relaxed. Scott is an acting wizard and will help you grow as an actor.,"This class is definitely applicable to actors of all levels, and should definitely be considered by people who are interested in directing/writing as well. Very worthwhile course.",It is great for the soul.  Do it!,"You'll learn more than just how to act better in this course! Scott is always available to you, even if you have questions about a scene you're doing outside of class. His knowledge is just spectacular. If you're not a big actor bear in mind that you have to learn lines, which isn't for everyone.","This class is a gem! I have learnt so much about how to act and more: interpersonal relationships (Scott's witty comments), my own personality/tactics better, perceiving others and overcoming fear etc.","You have to put in the work in order to get up in front of the class and perform, but there is a huge spectrum of preparedness that cannot really be quantified. Hours spent on coursework also depends on when you are performing. If it's an off-week there is less work but the week of performances you have to rehearse a good amount, chose a scene, read the play your scene is from, analyze the scene, etc. And how much time you spend on these things is a personal choice.","When you're not presenting a scene, the class can be quite boring, but Scott gives incredibly helpful constructive criticism, and this class will definitely improve your skills as an actor.","Not a life-changing course, but a solid foundation in the technique of Practical Aesthetics.",This is a great course if you are looking to learn an acting technique. The course is really about learning the technique and everyone definitely makes improvements by the end of the course. It gives you tools to analyze a scene and works a lot with moment to moment work.,"Scott is an incredible director. You might think you've gotten a scene or a character figured out, and he can completely debunk your theories and help you discover new meaning in the texts--translating that new meaning into  the portrayal of the character. The course is organized about as well as I can imagine it being, with each person doing three scenes which get reviewed and workshopped multiple times over the course of the semester, though this does mean that in a majority of the classes you won't be doing anything particularly interactive.",Do not take this class if you are not passionate about theater.
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 115: Acting Shakespeare,"If you love Shakespeare, if you love Remo, if you love performing, or if you think you might like any of those things but have not had the opportunity to try, this is the perfect class. You will learn far more than you could anticipate and the environment of the class hugely supportive.","This is a great class to take if you're interested in learning more about how to approach Shakespeare's texts. If you've done a lot of Shakespearean acting, you might find that you've heard some of the stuff discussed in this class before. But even veteran actors can probably learn something from this class, because Remo gives very nuanced and detailed feedback.","Remo is absolutely incredible. He completely throws himself into his teaching and expects you to bring the same level of enthusiasm to class as he does. The expectations for your performances get greater each week because it's a cumulative process of improving our technique, but I felt really accomplished and proud of what I understood about acting Shakespeare by the final class. I found the work we did to be actually quite challenging in the sense the you have to really push yourself to grow in a way that you cannot bullshit, but also incredibly empowering. If you are in the world of dramatic arts, you can't pass this opportunity up. The blog posts get tiring, but it's really minor busy work and a small price to pay for the attention and elite training that you get with Remo.","Acting Shakespeare is the funnest class I have taken at Harvard so far. Even if you don't have much experience in acting or performance that's ok because you'll learn SO MUCH in this class, make great friends, and work with amazing teachers. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!","Remo is so kind and knowledgeable, and makes sure that everyone, not just the person performing, learns from each performance. If you have any interest in acting, then you need to take this class.","If anything, take this class for the incredible personal attention you get. I found it invaluable in my development both as an actor and as a student.","If you like Shakespeare, you can't miss it. Remo is brilliant, no matter how experienced you are, you'll be challenged and you'll have loads of fun.","This course is a rigorous introduction to Acting Shakespeare. Remo is an excellent teacher who meets you at your level and pushes you to go beyond it. This course also gave me much better familiarity with Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Hamlet.","If you have an interest in acting in any genre, you should strongly consider taking this class before graduating. You will ultimately  develop a strong appreciation for how Shakespeare's text lends itself to being acted a certain way and you will be able to hone your general acting skills as well."
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 116: Acting Workshop: Comedy,"Scott Zigler is brilliant and deeply respectful and a great director. Getting to work on a scene with him is wonderful. Especially when you ask for him to put in time outside of class (which you should do!!! it might seem like he’s not that invested, but he just has a lot of students to work with, and so won’t volunteer to go the extra mile unless you ask for it). Also, the more prepared you as a student come in (as per usual), the more you get out of your time working on a scene with him. Be warned, though, students spend most of the time watching other students be directed and frankly, it gets hard to continue to remain attentive after a while, even though the professor is doing excellent work. On top of that, when you do get to work with him, it feels like there is nowhere close to enough time to really play as much as you might like. Also, it was possible to completely check out and not be called out for it. I get that it isn't only the teacher's responsibility to make sure students are paying attention, but i also don't think an hour and 15 minutes of the class should go by without 3/4 of the class having to have been paying attention.",Great comedy work - definitely more in-depth than I thought it would be.,You get what out of this class what you put into it.  And it is SO much fun.,"Ziggler is a genius. You learn, you write, you watch, you laugh - and every single day he amazes you with his insights. It's absurd. As many classes as you can take from him, take. You leave infinitely improved, no mater what your original level of skill. His attention not only to nuances of performance but to facilitating a more sophisticated and practical knowledge of comedy on stage is invaluable for anyone who is interested in pursuing the medium in any capacity.","Be prepared to take initiative and look for your own material. This can be the hardest part of the course, but it is the most rewarding since it introduces you to so many plays.","This course is supremely fun! If you're into comedy and have a spare class, it is a must-take. Scott is always available to you, even if you want to talk about a project unrelated to the class such as a play you're doing. The types of comedy covered are broad. Highly recommended. Scott is a fantastic teacher!","It's a fun way to learn about the nuts and bolts of comedy acting, as well as get a taste of comedy writing.","It's super helpful in learning how to mechanically create a comedic scene. It's also pretty laid-back and great when you work on your scene. Great class - awesome if you're interested in comedy, specifically in plays. We also got to write a sketch and get feedback, which was awesome.","Great class.  Scott's really smart, and you will become a better all around actor by taking this course","This class is so much fun! It's not too time intensive, except when it's your week to present your scene, but Scott is an amazing teacher. He clearly knows what he's talking about and sees every possible opportunity for a joke that there could be. No opportunity for comedy is left unturned!"
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 119: Vocal Production for the Stage
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 137: The Art of Scenography: 20th and 21st Century Directorial Concepts and Set Design,This is a phenomenal course! Julia is an amazing instructor. Definitely take this course.,I cross-registered for this course and loved it. Every lecture was engaging. Julia is unbelievably knowledgable about the material and extremely accessible to address concerns about the class and further explore topics we didn't fully cover outside of class. I highly recommend this course to undergraduates and graduate students alike.,"This is a great course where you'll learn a lot about theater and set design. It was truly a privilege to listen to Julia speak on these topics, and I felt like I had a lot to learn from her every class. It's not a stressful class at all, yet I learned a lot. I'd highly recommend this course if you have any interest in theater.",You don't have to be interested in set design to take this course.  The class focuses mostly on the different art movements and how they affected theater.  It's also almost like a history course--it talks a lot about the stories behind theater emerging in the 20th century which is really interesting.
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 171x: Participatory Theater
Dramatic Arts,DRAMA 172x: China on Stage,"Definitely take this class if you have an interest in art/theatre and are looking for a way to experience a new culture. The amount of reading is very doable, as is the amount of writing. You will get a lot out of the course!","This course is absolutely amazing, and Professor Conceison is such a vibrant, wonderful teacher who has so much firsthand knowledge of the subject, having studied it in China with some of the most important figures in Chinese theater today and has written and studied so much about it. You cannot miss the chance to take a course with her; you will learn so much and will come out of it with a new perspective on drama and a deeper understanding of literature, theater, and Chinese society. This class is challenging in the sense that you will learn a lot and the subject may be pretty new to you, but it is still accessible and really interesting - which is in my opinion the perfect kind of challenging. The plays are sometimes hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking, and through reading them, discussing them as a group over snacks, reading literary criticism, watching them, getting to ask questions of the playwrights themselves(!), and performing them with each other, you will understand them more deeply than you ever thought possible but will still realize you have so much more to learn. This was the most interesting class I ever took at Harvard, and I am so glad I made the decision to take it. YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. I guarantee you will love it."
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 21: The Dynamic Earth: Geology and Tectonics Through Time,"This is an okay class. Be prepared to memorize. The field trips are fun, as are the labs when they are hands-on (though they are three hours long and are sometimes busy work). Prof O'Connel is funny, though lectures can be dry and sometimes seem irrelevant. That being said, it is interesting to understand the macro-scale workings of the planet. Knowing a lot about rocks is valuable for hikers and climbers, and I suppose also if you just like rocks. Sarah is a great and really helpful TF.","First of all, this is an introductory course for the EPS department, not a totally fuzzy gen ed. There is a lot to learn for anyone that has had zero exposure to tectonic phenomena, rock types, mineral types, etc. All that said, if you have interest in geology, the planet, I thought this course was really worthwhile. 

The biggest problem I really found was organization and clarity of instructions. The labs are well designed and prepared, but sometimes it just isnt clear what is wanted. Also, sometimes it is assumed that you will just know everything that was taught in the last three lectures by the time lab comes around, but each lecture can have upwards of 20-30 new terms and concepts, so that could be unrealistic. Anyhow, the most challenging part was the field trips. TF-s will take you through most fo the material in person, but good luck trying to figure out what it wanted on your own.","Lecture is terribly boring, but you don't have to go since none of it shows up on the tests.","I think the Q scores for this class are misleading. It really isn't a terrible class at all; I actually enjoyed it on the whole. Professor O'Connell is a really nice guy who I would describe as a charming pedagogue. He has a lot of information to offer to the students. Also, there are no problem sets for this class, just weekly labs which you often complete in assigned lab hours anyways, so the workload for this class is very light. The material isn't hard to grasp if you do your due diligence, especially since the TFs are really helpful and do their best to make sure this class is run smoothly. Plus, the field trips are pretty fun and the second one allows you to get off campus for a weekend and spend some time outdoors. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to know more about the world around them.","This class was a good introduction to geology, although it could sometimes be a bit dry/boring. Rick knows a ton and is incredibly intelligent, but it was sometimes difficult to pay attention during lectures, especially first thing in the morning. The class is interesting if you are interested in the course material. For those who weren't, it was a bit rough. Field trips were awesome, and I'd say the majority of the learning during the course happened in the field with Francis. Overall I'd recommend it but only if you're genuinely interested in geology and the solid earth.","Students that have never had any exposure to geology or earth and planetary sciences should definitely take this class to expose themselves to this field; they might even end up switching to the concentration, which absolutely spoils its students.",Required for EPS concentrators. Dependent on the staff,"This is a class with a lot of potential, but it's disorganized to the point of being at times fairly distracting/frustrating. Prof O'Connell and the TFs are very nice though not really on the same page. Definitely consider this class if you think you're interested in earth science, but be ready to do a lot of learning (and memorizing) on your own. This ends up not being a hard class; the problem is that it's kinda stressful in that you never quite know how lectures and the textbook and labs and such are going to connect (or not). Field trips are really beautiful (to Boston Bay and the Berkshires/Appalachians) and make some of the tedium/very conceptual stuff worth it and actually fairly fascinating.","The class is disorganized but does manage to provide an overview of a variety of topics in geology. The lectures ranged from boring to interesting but the information you need for exams is mostly found in labs, not in lectures. I would recommend this class as a good introduction to earth sciences even though I have some issues with the overall structure of the course.",The course needs to be re-vamped and a better structure put in place but the information you learn is really interesting,This class is good if you are interested in the material. If you are interested you can look past all of the administrative issues there are.,This is an interesting class if this is the discipline you are absolutely interested in.,"Unless required through EPS, I wouldn't take this easy yet frustratingly disorganized SPU course until lectures are improved. If required, don't be scared, rocks are cool and the people are great!"
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 52: Introduction to Global Geophysics,Take this class. It's literally the best EPS class I've ever taken.,"This is a fantastic course that you should definitely take. First of all, Jerry is literally the best professor I have had at Harvard. He becomes personally invested in each student and always is available to talk about class or anything that strikes your fancy. Also, Harriet is the nicest TF on Harvard's campus; she is super helpful with the psets and review materials.

The workload in this class is totally bearable. You get 4 problem sets due two weeks apart and one midterm and a final project. It is not very work intensive, but you do end up learning a lot without the stress of constant work. 

Even if you think you might not be interested in geophysics or solid earth dynamics, you will find yourself thoroughly engaged and interested during each lecture. I found a whole new appreciation for earth science and geophysics in particular after this course, and plan to study the topic further while at Harvard.","This class is absolutely incredible, probably the best class that I've ever taken at Harvard. The teaching staff really cares about its students; by that I mean that they're really excited about the material, and do their best to provide support to the students. You cover a broad range of geophysical topics, and while you learn the derivations of a lot of concepts, you're testing on the general understanding of each phenomena. I took the class in conjunction with EPS 21 (several other students did this) and found that each complemented the other very well. Do not take the geology or physics requirements to be intimidating.",In this course you will learn lots of great stuff about many processes that keep the earth working.,"Amazing class.  Not a huge workload, but you still learn a ton.  Rare class where you're not slammed with work but still learn a ton just by sitting in lecture.  Definitely take this class, has been my favorite at Harvard.",Jerry is an amazing professor. The material is really fascinating and he knows an incredible amount about the field of earth science as a whole. It's tough material but really worthwhile.,"This isn't an easy course by any means, but Jerry and Harriett are more than happy to help you understand the material outside of class.","Jerry is a great lecturer and the topics are well-explained. The problem sets are very relevant to what is taught in class but can be difficult at times. However, both Jerry and Harriet put a lot of effort into their class and into making themselves available to help.","Jerry and Harriet are excellent teachers. The class is very relaxed and enjoyable, but you learn a lot if you pay attention.","It's well-taught. You will leave with a good understanding of introductory geophysics concepts. Simple mathematical laws are derived and used, but, overall, don't expect to leave with a deep understanding of the material in the course. Professor Mitrovica and Harriet are both very charismatic people who want you to do well and will help you if you are struggling in any area of the course."

Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 109: Earth Resources and the Environment,A great way to learn about serious issues,A lot of fun. Field trips are awesome. Professor Shaw is really engaging. Very manageable workload. Take it!,"This class is almost exclusively fact-memorization. This makes for relatively easy exams if you study for them. Everything on the lecture slides will be tested. If you'd like to learn about how to prospect for oil and mine for coal, definitely take this course. If you're interested in renewables, you'll learn a little bit, but the teaching staff has very clear interests and the environment isn't one of them.","The best class at Harvard in my opinion. While the material is hard and there is a lot of it, you learn about everything you've ever wanted to know about energy, both renewable and fossil fuels-based, in great detail. The labs can be tedious and long, but they do give you a fuller understanding of the topics from a practical perspective. If you don't have any background in geology, make sure to read a little about petroleum geology before taking the class, and you will do fine.","Labs can be tedious. Field trips are cool, but it is hard to fit into your schedule. Lectures can be boring at times, but final will quiz you on random details from lecture that are not in the lecture slides. You will learn a lot about all of our energy resources, but mineral resources are discusses until the last week. This class does not have a lot of hard geology, but it is very interesting and will make you more informed about our energy future. I'd take it again","Class is very informative, but the labs are a pain.",You will learn a ton from this class but it's not easy to get a good grade and be prepared to put a ton of time into it.,"It's a difficult class, but a very rewarding one overall.",Take this class if you want to to anything with energy after college. Aside from another one of Prof. Shaw's classes I believe this is the only one that really engages with the subject and I learned so much from it. But also be prepared to spend some time in labs.,"The material of this class is interesting, but lectures are pointless and labs are irrelevant and difficult",This is a great class. Makes you really think about turning on the lights and using materials. Highly recommend.  Well taught class about applicable interesting material.  Well organized and fast paced.  Makes you a better informed citizen on energy policy issues. Taught with minimal bias.,This course gives a strong foundation for understanding and evaluating the way people produce energy and the many resource options we have in doing so.,"If you're truly interested in the subject of this class its absolutely awesome. Lectures are inherently interesting for you, labs are cool (even if time consuming), and field trips are unique and exciting experiences. you won't have many other chances to tour a gas drilling rig! One of my favorite classes at Harvard, and it's a pretty light workload too. If you don't like energy or earth resources, your experience would probably not be as positive.",EPS 109 is a great and informative course with a superb Professor (Shaw). The only thing to be aware of is the extensively time consuming labs that this course has. One of the labs had me spending upwards of 12 hours on it. Other than that the field trips are worthwhile and educational.,"This course was very, very good. I highly recommend that every EPSer take it. It seriously is a MUST. You learn a great deal at a very manageable level, and the field trips are amazing. Also, Shaw is THE man!","Essentially a crash course on how energy is produced. You learn about all aspects of energy-- oil/gas, renewables, environmental impacts-- and overall I'm so glad I took this class. That said, it was painful at times; labs were unnecessarily time-consuming and long. You cover an insane amount of material, so definitely not an easy A (or an easy B!) but absolutely worth taking if you're interested in energy, no matter your academic background.  The field trip was fun and relevant, but does fall during reading period (you've been warned).",Take this class! It is so interesting and relevant. I feel like I left with a broad range of knowledge on cutting-edge issues.,"This course really taught me a working knowledge of the various forms of energy and their relative benefits and environmental impacts.  It's a must-take if you want to be know where energy comes from and what are options are going forward.  As a junior finishing the fall, this may very well be the best class I've taken at Harvard.",Absolutely loved this class. The labs and field-trips take time but are entirely worth it.,"It was a good class overall! The material was relevant and I definitely learned a ton. Both Prof. Shaw and Joe were good lecturers and the teaching staff was very accessible. I'd definitely recommend this class.

One main reservation: be prepared for the labs to take up to double the time allotted. Not every lab was as bad (and some can pretty easily be completed during section times) but others require lots of work outside of class. The five no-penalty late days on labs will be your friends.

On the field trips: the day-long field trips were both really cool (especially the trip to the nuclear plant). The longer field trip was also really great (especially the shale gas rig!!), but if you're taking this course in the winter, BE PREPARED. I physically didn't own enough layers to keep myself warm enough on the trip. If ever in the future this course goes back to being offered in the spring, TAKE IT IN THE SPRING."
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 181: Historical Geobiology,"This is probably the best class I have taken at Harvard. We read really interesting papers on issues at the forefront of modern research, and then have fantastic discussions in class every day. The grad students and postdocs who sit in offer an enormous knowledge base in all sorts of areas.","This seminar-style class is quite interesting. Be comfortable volunteering to present, speaking for 15 minutes every other week, and speaking with the other students and Prof Knoll. However, the expectations were not as clear as I had hoped, so it was difficult to gauge my status throughout the semester.",Really great class. Prof. Knoll is really knowledgeable and approachable. Really great for understanding how biology and geology interact.
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 186: Low Temperature Geochemistry I: Introduction to biogeochemical cycles,"This class is fantastic. Dave and Andy are both wonderful and extremely dedicated. The course material is incredibly interesting. The course is not extremely rigorous and very little background in chemistry or geology is necessary. You'll learn a lot, although there's very little work and it's not at all a stressful experience.","If you need to know things about stable isotopes and how to use them, this is a great class to take.","Does a very good job of covering the basics of biogeochemical cycling (isotopes being simply a tool to understand its dynamics), without exposing students to undue time consumption or stress."
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 200: Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 208: Physics of Climate,"If you have an interest in atmospheric science and/or climate modeling, and you are comfortable with a very mathematically-based approach, take this course!  You get to see a lot of very interesting topics over a broad range.  The course staff is very relaxed but engaged with the material, and you also get to learn directly from someone making strides in the field.  Not having a basic background in atmospheric science can be disheartening at times but the p-sets will help you come out with a good understanding.  The TF was also very helpful!  The midterm and final assignments were a great way to get into the depth of a couple topics and really see the forefront of atmospheric/climate research.  The class in general is pretty light on workload since problem sets are spaced to every two weeks.","This is a really helpful course, helping you build up a complementary understanding of atmospheric and oceanic science.","Does a good job - mainly because of Prof. Kuang being a very solid lecturer and responsive to questions - of covering the broadest generalities of ocean and atmosphere circulation, without delving into the particular phenomena much. Focus on the mathematical tools for investigating these phenomena demands that the student have a strong footing in real analysis."
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 236: Environmental Modeling,This class will give you a basic understanding of atmospheric modeling from box to 3-D models.
Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 239: The Consequences of Energy Systems,"Good course that imparts wide knowledge on climate change, and how various energy systems affect the environment","great for fulfilling a requirement. limited course-work and only one graded assignment. for those hoping to gain an in-depth scientific understanding (graduate level) of climate change should look elsewhere. However, if you put in a lot of time and effort into the final project, you'll learn a TON about energy technologies and energy resources.","Excellent overview of climate system, climate change, and energy systems. Good starting point if you're interested in those issues. Not too much work except for final paper.",Take seriously the final assignment.  The exercise is truly transformative.,Excellent overview of many aspects of the climate problem. Does not go into much depth.

Earth and Planetary Sciences,E-PSCI 381: Topics in Stable Isotope Geobiology and Earth History
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE Ba: Elementary Modern Chinese,"It is a lot. Work every day, so only take it if you are dedicated. But you learn so much.","1. You have a choice of whether to learn simplified or traditional.  Only learn traditional if you’re going into East Asian studies (or planning on studying something where you would need to be able to read older texts that are in traditional), or if you want to go to Taiwan and Hong Kong and want to be able to read things. Although even then, it’s not necessary.  Traditional is NOT helpful for if you want to go to mainland China – at all.  At first, professors use traditional all the time in class (in powerpoints, grammar handouts, etc.).  However,  by the end of the year, everything was being written in simplified.  

2. Be prepared to spend a lot of time studying characters – especially if you’re taking traditional.  You need to learn how to write 20 per week, but be able to recognize ALL the characters in the book for each lesson.  I made flashcards for everything, which was really helpful.  

3. Overall, would recommend this class.  It’s fun and you’ll really learn a lot, even if you’ve had Chinese before.  I was pleased with the amount of characters we learned and how much we could read by the end of the semester.  If your other classes involve a lot of writing (or if you’re a grad student), this class will be a nice departure from that.   Of course you still need to dedicate a lot of time to the class, but when it’s a different kind of homework from what you usually have, it’s a nice break.  It may be a lot of work, but you’ll feel like you really learned and accomplished a lot by the time the semester is over. Definitely recommend!","You will learn quite a bit of Chinese for a beginning class. However, be prepared to commit time to memorizing characters especially. The grammar is not especially hard.","Good course to start off learning Chinese. Lessons are structured logically and progress as a decent pace that is neither fast not slow. By the end of te semester, you will be surprised at how much you have learned and honestly be able to carry at least basic Chinese conversations. The only annoying part is that there are a lot of people with prior Chinese experience which may make it frustrating if you are just starting to learn. Overall great class and the teachers were all wonderful and sections is actually really fun!","If you want learn Chinese, this is the best way to learn it.","THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT HARVARD THUS FAR!!! Seriously, the Chinese Language Department is the most interactive and attentive department at Harvard. All the TFs and the Professor truly want you to succeed and they offer so many opportunities for you to ask questions and seek help. I have nothing bad to say about this course.","Chinese is a great language to learn, and this course does a great job doing it. It can require a good deal of work and memorization, but it is worth it.",Spend time practicing with a teacher and also on your own. Practice literally makes perfect.,teaching faculty is great and many opportunities to practice. very rewarding if you put in the work,"Do not be afraid to take this class just because it's a completely new language! The regularity of the schedule makes sure that you can't fall behind as long as you put in a little work everyday, and the teachers are all very available and quick to help. There's also a lot of small assignments that end up as padding for your grade, so the course is overall very manageable.","Fantastic class with a great teaching staff who really want to help you. I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue studying Chinese after fulfilling my language requirement, but now I plan to take Chinese beyond the first year because the teachers made it such a great experience. This class does have a good amount of work, so be prepared to study a decent amount every week, especially in the beginning when you're doing the foundation work. It'll make the rest of the course much easier!","Pay attention, and don't slack off, and you will be fine.","This class is awesome -- if you have any interest in Mandarin Chinese, you should definitely consider taking it. Admittedly, the workload is rather immense, but the good thing is that you are never really faced with one huge assignment; rather, you end up doing a ton of smaller pieces of work (weekly homeworks, dialogue memorization, character practice for dictation etc) over the course of the entire semester. Do not do what I did and fall behind; the course can get very nerve-wracking in that case. This class is also great for those who think they simply ""don't possess the language gene"". After 3 months, you will be amazed when looking at the progress you've made.","Very good and fun class to be, but don't slack off because you might be left behind forever due to its fast pace. But if you come to all the classes and sections, you'll be fine.","It takes a lot of hours of work per week, but the progress you make toward the goal of learning the language is insane. But, seriously, sooooo much work.","You can't go wrong with this class - it's harder to learn than some other languages because characters are completely different from letters, but it has a lot of applications and it also opens up the possibility of working/studying abroad in Asia.","If you've ever had any desire to learn Chinese, take this course!!! It was amazing from the instructors to how well the material is taught to the other students to how much you'll learn in just one semester (significantly more than one semester of a high school language class). The Harvard Chinese department is famous for how well it teaches around the world for good reason. It's also great, because the instructors rotate sections, so you get to have each for a bit. Unlike previous years, you could also opt to just learn simplified characters this year, which was great.  Also, even if you're an upperclassman, don't be hesitant to take it--I did, even though I've already satisfied my language requirement and had a fantastic time. The course is a mix of all years and graduate students, which was fun. As long as you do the work for each day (although there is something due virtually every day, it's not a lot), it's not as hard as others may make it out to be. Only downside--the course is located in Vanserg, which is absurdly far. It's hard to take classes on either side, because you'll be perpetually late.","If you are interested in chinese, take it 100%.  If you're not passionate about it, it might be a challenge","TAKE THIS COURSE if you have any interest in learning Chinese! It is challenging and time-consuming, especially if you aren't particularly adept at learning languages, but totally worth it. If you are willing to put in the work you will be amazed at how much you can learn in just one semester. I can't wait to continue my study of Chinese in this excellent department!","This is an awesome course that teaches you a ton over the course of just one semester. If you have a lot of exposure to Chinese please don't take this class, you just make it harder on actual beginners like myself who are easily intimidated by people who took Chinese in high school. Great class if you're willing to put in the time!","Great way to learn a lot of Chinese in a short amount of time! Definitely requires work, but the teaching staff is amazing, and will make it worthwhile! I think anyone is capable of doing it if they put in the work.","If you really want to learn Chinese, this is the best way to get started.  You learn so much, and build such a good foundation with such little time.","Even though many students come into Chinese Ba with a few years of Chinese classes, total beginners shouldn't be afraid to take this course; after all, it is supposed to cater to beginners. The professor and TFs will hold your hand in the beginning and through to the end of the course if you find you need it. The dialogues are fun and the class is quick and dynamic, so I personally enjoyed the class very much. I don't really recommend Chinese Ba to people who are looking to painlessly knock out a language requirement, but I definitely do to anyone who is remotely interested in the Chinese language.","This is the best taught class offered at Harvard. It is very difficult, but equally rewarding. This class is so awesome. I looked forward to going to Chinese everyday and I want to now pursue a Chinese citation so I can continue to work with this incredible department.",This is a really solid introduction to Chinese. The teaching staff's teaching methods are very good. It feels like there has been research into language learning that went into designing this course,"really amazing program. take advantage of the languages at this school, you won't regret it. You need to put time in and it's not an easy class, but if you want to learn Chinese there is no better place to do it.",Keep up with the vocabulary and grammar! It will only make the later lessons easier to understand,"The amount of work you do in this class depends on how much prior experience you have studying Chinese. If you have no exposure whatsoever, it will be a very challenging course. If you have studied a little bit of Chinese before, the class will be much, much more managable.","This is a thorough, well-structured, and fun class.","Chinese Ba is an excellent and very well organized course. All the instructors are very helpful and genuinely try to make the course fun. The drill section was probably the best part of the course. It both reinforced the material from lecture, and allowed people to get to know their classmates. That said, Chinese is a very difficult language, and be aware that it's very easy to fall behind in lecture if you don't study for a few days.",Such a rewarding class!,"This class will be a lot of work, but the language skills you will emerge with are extremely rewarding.","Be prepared to invest a ton of energy and time into this course. It is not a joke. If you're looking for an easy way to fulfill the foreign language requirement, look elsewhere.","This class moves at a very fast rate, but it a nice introduction course to learning Chinese.",This is not an easy class but if you love languages definitely take it.,"It is a great course that is taught exceedingly well (much better than high school Chinese classes). That being said, there will be individuals in the class that have taken some Chinese before, just don't get discouraged.",Teachers are wonderful!,This course is very fast-paced and you have to be ready to put in a lot of outside work to be prepared in class and for assessments.,It's tough but worth it! Very fast paced but at the end realizing how much you've learned in a completely new language is extremely rewarding.,"This class comes with a significant time commitment, but is well worth it. It gives you a functional knowledge of speaking/reading/writing Chinese.","This is an excellent class! Teachers are supremely amazing, and the way they structure the classes are so efficient. Definitely take it, they make learning Chinese fun and enjoyable!",If you're looking to learn Chinese this is the absolute best place to do it. The teachers really care about your experience in the class and are willing to help you individually anytime you need it.,"If you're serious about wanting to learn Chinese, this course is for you. It moves at a quick but manageable pace. Don't expect to move through it like a romance language (I studied French), they're very different and Chinese requires a lot of your time. However, after one semester it'll feel extremely rewarding and I'm excited to continue studying it. I studied Chinese in China for a summer and while I learned a lot of spoken Chinese I left China not knowing how to read or write anything. This course is comprehensive and it covers it all!","This class is definitely worth your time! It is very fun and engaging, and you will learn a lot. All of the teachers are fantastic!","Wonderful course. You'll not only learn a ton (and watch your skills grow exponentially by the week) but have a ton of fun. I've never taken a class that's made me laugh so hard on a regular basis. The class exhibits some of the best teaching at Harvard (these instructors straight-up care about your learning), and if you've got a bit of a knack for languages, the work won't crush you whatsoever (the weekly assessments and homework are extremely reasonable). Lastly, you'll make friends in this course. Section thrice a week develops a real community.",It is a great class to pick up a difficult language that Chinese is. You will get a lot out of it if you put in the time and the effort.,"Workload can get rigorous for someone with no background in Chinese, but it's well worth it. If you put in the time, you will look back and be amazed at how much you learn over the course of the semester.","From someone who has studied several languages, Chinese Ba is far and above the best language course I have taken. Mandarin is a difficult language to learn, but throughout this course I felt a tangible sense of progress each class session. The teachers are helpful and enthusiastic, and all of the work assigned pointed at a goal of being able to converse fluently in the language, which it accomplished very well.","Chinese Ba is extremely strong in teaching spoken Mandarin. The instructors, who are extremely enthusiastic and friendly, reinforce language learning through call-and-response exercises and dialogues. Sections and lecture are genuinely fun (and, at times hilarious), which is a good thing, because this class meets every day. Every week, students are expected to teach themselves how to read approx. 40 characters, and write half as many. There are also weekly homework sheets, dialogue memorizations, and dictation quizzes. Though the workload ramps up towards the end of the course, it is completely do-able so long as you are diligent about practicing about half an hour every night. By the end of the semester, class will be taught almost entirely in Chinese, and you'll find yourself understanding every word.","To master the language and truly excel in this class, you need to practice every single day. Chinese is very difficult, and if you don't maintain a strong study routine it could be a very long semester. But if you're willing to put in the time, this is an amazing opportunity; rarely at this university will you receive so much individual attention from excellent teachers.","Take the course if you wanna learn Chinese. Don't take it for fun, unless you already know some Chinese. If you are true beginner, meaning you've had zero Chinese language experience, than be ready for a tough semester with a lot of studying. In the end, you learn a ton of Chinese, and the language that seemed so hard before starts looking easier and easier.",A very instructive and even fun class to expose you to Chinese language as well as culture. The teaching staff is also wonderful and receptive.,"Chinese Ba is hard. Even if you work diligently, it's hard. You're going to wake up some days and hate it, then feel okay about it, then hate it again. But it's worth it.","If you are willing to be attentive and motivated throughout a semester in Chinese Ba, and if you recognize that your commitment (or lack thereof) one week will affect your understanding the next week, you are prepared for this class. Anyone with an interest in beginning Chinese should take this class; with enough study, you can excel.","If you're interested in learning a language, learn chinese! It might be difficult at first (especially the tones!) but after a while, you get adjusted to the pace. Zhou Laoshi and the rest of the staff are very enthusiastic about teaching and will help you learn the most chinese you possibly can.","I decided to take Chinese as a junior after previously taking Spanish. I never studied Chinese before, and this class was very difficult. However, I have taken few classes at Harvard as rewarding as Chinese BA. Be ready to work, and, if you commit to the course, you will see incredible results."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE Bx: Elementary Chinese for Advanced Beginners,"While this class is a good introduction to the Chinese language for students with advanced backgrounds, be prepared for the workload! When they say that this is an accelerated class, they mean it- the material is taught quickly and everything is cumulative, so if you don't keep up it is far too easy to fall behind. Only take this class if you're up for the challenge!","Take this class! I cannot recommend it enough. Huang laoshi, Xu laoshi, and Zhu laoshi are all so nice and wonderful and really know how to teach Chinese. I learned a lot while also having a lot of fun! However, be prepared for the workload. Because this class covers two semesters of Chinese in one, there can be a lot of work. Don't let that discourage you from taking this course though! I genuinely felt that I was having fun doing Chinese homework every day. You won't regret it!","Chinese Bx outside of the classroom is a rigorous way to learn a lot of Chinese characters, and quickly. However, the experience inside the classroom gets tiring pretty quickly, as it becomes the same routine over and over again, five times a week. Although there is some speaking practice, it's not nearly engaging enough. Reminds me of a typical Saturday Chinese school experience from childhood.","This class is quite rewarding if you put in the effort. At times, it can get overwhelming, particularly if you fall behind on your characters. For that reason, make sure you stay on top of your assignment and constantly review your vocabulary. It is essential for success in this class. As for the environment, I thought it was wonderful. You get to go to Huang Laoshi's house for dinner at the end of the course!",Be aware that it is a lot of work. Two semester's worth in one.,"Taking this class was honestly one of the most enjoyable academic experiences I have ever had. Looking back on the past semester, I can't believe I have learned so much in so little time. You will learn a lot and have lots of fun, since the class really feels like a small community. Definitely get to know your classmates and teachers, they are just as important in the experience of Chinese Bx as the language itself.","If you're a freshman, I'd highly recommend this course just for the reason that it feels like a safe, supportive environment in what can be an intimidating campus. As for learning Chinese, if you have a decent amount of Chinese experience, I would recommend taking a higher level class because this class will be too easy for you. Bx is really meant for students who can read and write very, very little.","If you want to improve your Chinese, and already know how to speak the language well, then take this class.",Take it if you have a lot of background in speaking and listening.,"The only thing I liked more than the amount of quality material that I learned in the course was the teaching staff. Huang Laoshi, Xu Laoshi, and Zhu Laoshi are all great teachers that deserve praise for their work. I can't wait for 123xb next semester!","This is an absolutely amazing course - as I'm sure many of my fellow Bx friends would tell you. You will learn a lot in not just reading and writing but speaking and listening too. The teachers really care for their students and are such great personalities in the classroom. They really understand the students they are teaching. I had pretty rusty Chinese abilities coming in (from a Cantonese-speaking family and even then, my Chinese isn't that great) - but since I'd taken Chinese in high school, I figured I'd start here instead of Chinese Ba - great decision and would highly recommend the course!","This class is absolutely fantastic if you want to learn how to read/write Chinese quickly! It's not too much work, but you really do see your improvement over the semester. The teachers are kind (even when you're late) and there are a lot of extra credit opportunities. If you put in the effort, you will get an A.","Chinese Bx teachers are friendly, dedicated, passionate, and committed to the improvement of their students. The real strength of this course is its full immersiveness - you are basically put into a Chinese speaking family for a week, and although there is homework every night, quizzes every week, multiple essays and tests, and a couple group video projects, the environment of the course makes it fun.

The only downside is that teaching materials are not as organized as they could be (finding note files on the course iSite is hard because lecture notes are not organized by date and the titles all look the same), and much of the grammar comes without explanation, so make sure that you are confident in your heritage Mandarin and that you don't need things explained, you just need to know how to write them.

Still, as a heritage student with two Chinese-speaking parents who learned to speak but not to write, I recommend this course.","The professors care a lot, and it really translates to you learning the material better. Lectures were entertaining and informative, and homework is necessary to your success - not much can be considered busywork without motive.
Take it if you're a ABC wanting to finally learn to read and write - properly.",Loved it,"It's a very fun course, the teachers are all super nice and they really care about the students. It may be challenging but if you work hard to do the homework and memorize all the characters, you should be fine.","It's a time consuming course, with daily work ranging from half an hour to an hour and a half especially when there's a dictation (not counting studying for tests). It's not especially difficult if you are willing to put in the time and effort, as there are extra credit opportunities and the teachers are more than willing to help you if you need it. The tests are fair, but focus a lot more on sentence structure and grammar than I expected. The classroom atmosphere is fun and familial, which is great for learning a language.  If you are interested in practicing your Chinese and/or want to fill your language requirement, and are willing to put in time, this can be a rewarding way to do so.",It is very helpful and the workload is not too much,"Take this class! Chinese Bx is a fantastic class, not only for how much you learn in one semester, but for the fantastic community that this class strives to build. Going to Huang Laoshi's house at the end of the semester was very much a highlight. The TA's are also extremely committed to help you improve your Chinese by providing lots of good feedback.","Warning: assignments in this class build up with astonishing speed as the semester goes on. When that happens, you do NOT want to fall behind. 

Otherwise, fantastic class and totally worth taking if you're a Heritage student who can't read/write but can speak decently, because Harvard is one of the only places anywhere that offers a class specifically designed for this kind of person. It's part of a two-semester track, Chinese Bx in the fall (one year of beginner level) and Chinese 123xb (a year of intermediate) in the spring, at the end of which you'll be able to jump into advanced Chinese.  

Reasons why it's a great class: 
The teachers are amazing and incredibly helpful and enthusiastic. The classmates are usually motivated, though you will find some more committed than others. Keep company with the more committed students, study outside of class with them, practice your Chinese as often as possible with Chinese friends, go to office hours, and do your homework every day, and you WILL succeed. 

Problems with the class: the website is disorganized, and the coursebook is not the prettiest. In other words, minor issues.","Such a great language class! Definitely take it. Not only did I learn Chinese as a language, I learned a lot about the culture. Most of the students are ABCs who went to Chinese school and didn't really care about Chinese back then. After taking the class, however, many of us have gained higher respect for our heritage and have grown to appreciate it much more. ChineseBX really tries to be a family and the teachers are so sweet. They truly care about the students. The workload is OK, if you follow the schedule they give you.","The knowledge you get out of this course really depends on your enthusiasm for the material. If you are very enthusiastic, this course can be extremely rewarding.",Huang makes everyday of Harvard special. She doesn't only teach the class for the purpose of helping students with Chinese; she really does go above and beyond in making sure people are comfortable with life at Harvard.,"it is just the right amount of difficulty if you are already fluent in Chinese, but it definitely takes a lot of time since class is every day and there is homework every day as well.","One of the best foreign language classes offered at Harvard. Huang laoshi, Zhu laoshi, and Xu laoshi are also three incredibly supportive educators who truly care about teaching the Chinese language to their students."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 106a: Introduction to Literary Chinese,I likely to recommend.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 107a: Intermediate Literary Chinese,This class is a lot of work but also a lot of fun!
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 120a: Intermediate Modern Chinese,"While intimidating, the Chinese language is an equally rewarding subject to consider studying.","Chinese 120a is a very rigorous course. It is well taught, and is a course that requires a lot of INPUT. Take this class if you are passionate about the language and want to take advantage of a great department. The department is structured such that you will receive significant 1-on-1 time with professors.",It's amazing and everyone should take it!,be prepared to put in a lot of work!,"Quizzes are extremely difficult, expect to spend lots of time in preperation",The Chinese program at Harvard has no equal.,"This class builds well off of what we learned in Ba and Bb. While there could be more focus on speaking over writing, Chinese 120a has helped me understand the language and culture better. If you want to continue to study Chinese, this class is both an excellent choice and your only choice.","This class is fantastic--Chinese is definitely a difficult language, but if you're willing to put in the work it's fascinating and rewarding.",Great course to take if you want to continue to improve your skill in the language.,"I really love learning Chinese at Harvard and I think the 120a course is great. My reservations are actually that it's too easy, but which I mean that I see a lot of areas in which other language courses push us that Chinese doesn't. For instance, I also took second year Spanish and feel that we were given far more writing tasks in Spanish than in Chinese. I would really appreciate the opportunity to improve upon my writing ability instead of just doing homework sheets with sentences that are really simple and come straight from the text book.","If any part of you wants to learn Chinese, do it here! Great class, difficult, but you will see results.","This course is excellent for teaching you massive amounts of Chinese in a relatively short period of time. You should take this course if you have an interest in improve your language skills beyond the basic level. Lessons cover practical topics, like travel, food, and studying, which gears you well for any travel abroad you may wish to take in the future. Do the preparation before class by reading the dialogues and learning the vocabulary because you will be more likely to retain the lessons for the assessments throughout the semester.","It's my favorite class at Harvard. Definitely take it, the teachers are wonderful.","Really felt like I solidified my basic Chinese. Textbook and materials are well written, and class is well structured. Harder material than Ba/Bb but doesn't seem harder because it is similarly structured. Would definitely recommend","More no-nonsense than Chinese Ba or Bb, but it's still a great class and a ton of fun.",Take if you only have 1 year of experience with chinese.  Do not take if you have more than that.,"This course requires a lot of hard work and daily practice, but the language improvement is noticeable.","Out of all the classes I took this semester, I found Chinese to be the best taught, and as a result my Chinese improved a tremendous amount, and that I learned more in this class than I did in any others.","Make sure to have a solid background on reading, writing. and grammar as it will be expected of you in the course. You will not be able to speak English in class unless it is completely necessary, so be prepared to practice speaking a lot.","Excellent course, make sure to review and practice with the grammar patterns and vocab frequently","Similar to Chinese Bb in how the course is run. Very stringent grading, with policies for point deduction extremely vague. However, the amount you'll learn over the course of the semester is huge; I cannot recommend this course highly enough. My only qualms are that there are not greater measures taken in order to ensure vocabulary words and grammar structures are thoroughly learned and remembered for the entire semester.","The teachers are perfect, you'll learn a ton without feeling too overwhelmed","If you're okay with taking a challenge, take this course. It's totally cool and absolutely worth it.","This class, like all Chinese language classes, requires a lot of work. There are two dictations per week of about 25 characters, a homework assignment (which'll take between half an hour and an hour), a recitation, and oftentimes also a quiz or essay. Don't be fooled by this only being a second-year language course: I came into it as a freshman, having taken up to 5th year Chinese in high school (I skipped a year in the language because I stayed in China for a summer with an immersion program), and it was definitely the right place for me and still a challenge at times. 

That said, this is a FANTASTIC Chinese course. I think it would be very difficult to find one of its caliber anywhere else. The teachers are extremely kind and organized, and you get a ton of individual attention. If you're looking to hone your Chinese skills, this department is extremely well-qualified to help."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 130a: Pre-Advanced Modern Chinese,This class is great.  Boring but you learn Chinese.,"This is a great course if you're looking to expand upon your Chinese speaking and reading skills. It has a similar format to Chinese 120 and consists of a lot of vocabulary and grammar memorization, but it is helpful if you want to pursue learning Mandarin. It is not an overly rigorous course and not the best if you're looking to only focus on oral skills.","You should be willing to put in consistent amount of work throughout the semester. As long as you stay on top of everything, this course won't be difficult at all.",You need to put in consistent effort to make it worthwhile (which the teachers do a good job of making sure/encouraging you do),"I love the laoshis! It was always such a lovely way to start the day, even if Vanserg is in the middle of nowhere.","Great course, especially drill section. Similar to the other Chinese courses before it, except Hu Laoshi is the bomb (and he helps you during dictations). It wasn't so hard for me once I got into a good routine, and I felt it was a nice break from doing readings or psets from other classes.","Language is a skill you won't regret learning, and here you can learn it without it being a pain (you'll enjoy it!).","The class will teach you the Chinese you want to know.  However, be warned: this class takes up an extraordinary amount of time (just like most language classes, but especially with Asian languages).  I took this course (and 120b) with a five class schedule, and it was absolute hell in terms of workload.  But the class is effective, so that made up for the pressure.  If you want to take 130 (or any Chinese class), don't load up on courses.","There's a fair amount of work to this class, but it is well rewarded: you will come out with a much better grasp of Chinese reading and writing. This course has been another great semester in Harvard's amazing Chinese language program; I have taken a Chinese class every semester I've been here, and it's always been one of my best-taught and favorite courses every semester.",Chinese 130a is a very enjoyable and manageable class. It's not hard but you have to put time into studying for tests and tingxie. The teachers are great!,DO IT.,Chinese 130a is an incredible class. We learn so much new vocabulary and grammar in just a semester and develop an enriched understanding of the issues facing contemporary China.,This class is a great continuation of chinese studies,"It's a class that took a lot of my time but I was always happy to go to class and drill sections, which says a lot compared to most of my other classes.",Be prepared to work hard + learn a lot!,"If you've already done 120, there's no reason not to take this class! The grammar is a bit more complicated and the texts are a bit more in-depth but all-in-all it's a very natural transition from 120. Take it!","Lots of work, but well worth it. Keep on top of the work!",stay on top of your assignments,The vocabulary is pretty hard. But the course and instructors are fantastic. People who came straight to Chinese 130 rather than after Ba Bb 120a 120b seemed to struggle a little in the beginning because the teachers here focused a lot on tones in Ba Bb 120a 120b.,"If you've taken Chinese before at Harvard, you know what you're in for - a fantastic class in basically every way. While harder than 120, it's not an unreasonable step-up - if you had a good grasp of the 120 material, the only thing you really have to work hard on and might present a challenge is speaking and listening skills.","Chinese 130a is absolutely a worthwhile class! More so than ever before, it focuses on topics that are extremely relevant, interesting, timely, and even a little controversial. You'll learn to discuss issues like Chinese economic issues, pollution and ways to reduce it, marriage and dating, food safety, copyright infringement disputes, etc. The grammar points are very well taught and well structured. Of course, most importantly, the teaching staff of this class are all absolutely phenomenal, some of the most friendly, accessible, talented, and helpful teachers you'll find in the Chinese department!"
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 130xa: Pre-Advanced Modern Chinese for Heritage Students,Liu laoshi da best!,"If you're not 100% sure that you want to continue with Chinese or pursue a Chinese, don't take 130xa. You won't make as much progress as you did in the first two years (or two semesters) of your Chinese studies, simply because you've already reached a competent level of speaking and writing. You learn more written Chinese grammar and vocabulary, but if you want to study Chinese to talk to your relatives or to do business, this course isn't really what you're looking for.","If you are looking to improve your Chinese as a heritage speaker (or non-heritage speaker), this is definitely the class to take! Liu Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, and Ye Laoshi are all fantastic professors and wonderful people. Their enthusiasm will make you love Chinese. Coming into the class, I was hesitant because I hadn't really spoken/written/read Chinese in years and was afraid that learning Chinese would become a chore again, with all of the work and assignments this class seemed to require. But you quickly get used to the pace of the course and the weekly assignments become natural to you, and all of the assignments are actually useful in reinforcing your grasp of the material. If you're rusty, 130xa will quickly brush up your reading/speaking/writing skills again, and you'll feel much more comfortable with the language!","This was a good chinese class that didnt require homework everyday. Having said though, there always seemed to be an essay due and we often did writing tasks in lecture class. There were high levels of speaking and discussion and worked towards a more formal speaking and writing language. I enjoyed this class although the work could be frustrating at times, but was not difficult to do well. Teachers were supportive and fun.","Teacher is extremely nice, work is very manageable.","This was a fantastic class. It was engaging and fun, and my Chinese improved a lot as a result of just one semester. I highly recommend this course to anyone considering taking it.","So, I actually took this class after starting last year with Ba and taking 120 at HBA. Needless to say, I am not a heritage speaker. This class was very, very tough, especially as I switched in 3 weeks late, but doable for my skill level. Liu, Pan and Ye laoshi's are all super sweet and were more than wiling to help me when I (frequently) struggled. The structure of the class is fantastic, and the mini projects and timed advertisements felt more applicable to the real world than my previous Chinese classes.  I've had a great time and I know my Chinese has improved-- what more can you ask for?","Try to speak as much as you can in class, even if you feel that others are better at speaking than you are, because this is the main way you will have to improve your spoken Chinese."

East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 140a: Advanced Modern Chinese,"Definitely a big jump from 130a/b, but very rewarding! The topics of conversation become very real world.","Gao Lasohi is a fantastic lecturer and the class is fun. Even though it meets every day, I enjoy my time in 140.",Study the review sheets and the grammar notes.,"Just make sure that you check the upcoming weekly schedule IN ADVANCE on Sundays. If you do so, and you start looking at the texts and new words early, it will make you learn the material better and spend less time overall.","This class focuses on teaching you lots of vocabulary and grammatical structures in a very short amount of time. You'll blow through longish essays and passages each week, focusing on the vocab that the teachers emphasize. The teachers will skip over certain vocab words in the list or even unfamiliar non-vocab words in the text, so watch out for that. The teachers also try to teach you speed-reading in Chinese by making you scan a passage one paragraph at a time and then going through sentence by sentence. I feel like my oral fluency and comfort in conversational situations decreased, while my ability to read advanced passages increased and my ability to write at an advanced level remained about the same, as I noticed myself and my peers falling back on familiar, non-advanced vocab.",Chinese 140a is an awesome course!  It has fantastic teaching staff that are very engaged and highly accessible.  I learned a lot and made many new friends.  I would strongly recommend this course to anyone thinking about taking it.,"This class is not as good as its predecessors.  It is way less fun than Bx, 123xb, HBA.  Although the topics you discuss should be interesting, and you are really just learning more formal ways to say things that you mostly know how to say, this class was pretty painful.  The material (vocab, grammar, chengyu) is difficult to retain and seems pretty irrelevant.  I didn't see much improvement in my Chinese.","Take it, but know that it'll be kind of a pain. You'll be reading about social issues in China and random Chinese essays, so it's not gonna be super fun. I kinda messed around in the class and question how much I actually learned, but I think that it could be helpful.","I really loved this class and it was the perfect continuation of Chinese 130. The grammar concepts can be difficult but the teachers in this class are extremely dedicated and make sure you understand the material well by the end of each lesson. Assignments were similar to those in 130 if not a bit more demanding. Gao Laoshi, as always, was incredibly enthusiastic and a fantastic teacher overall. Zhang Laoshi and Zhu Laoshi were also very helpful in section and provided thorough feedback on assignments. Take this class!","This class is a ton of work, but to really learn Chinese, this is what it takes.  The teachers are fantastic and will help you at every step of the way.","Chinese 140 is just like any other Chinese class, but you also learn a little bit about Chinese culture. It's a piece of cake if you're coming from 130x.","Stay up to date with the work, review a bit each day, and you really should have no problems!","If you've come this far in Chinese, you will not be disappointed by Chinese 140! The teachers are fantastic, as per usual in the Chinese department, and the class covers interesting and nuanced topics like 胡同文化 and 流行音乐。",This class is a good taste of what formal Chinese looks like. The teachers really care about the students and you won't regret taking it.,"This is a really good class, but the level is pretty high.","This course definitely improves your written Chinese to a huge degree, but be prepared for quite a bit more work and higher expectations than in 130.","Very good for Chinese speaking; this is the first time I have really felt my speaking, reading and writing skills improve in a Chinese course.",I would definitely tell them to be prepared to do a lot of intensive work. A lot of the intensive work is beneficial.,"I am now able to read more in Chinese than I could before, but reading a newspaper article is still a bit of a struggle. The class is very well organized and the teachers are great."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 142a: Advanced Conversational Chinese,"This class is fun and low stress. It's also super useful, because these are the topics that you talk about everyday, and you learn how to speak intelligently about these topics in Chinese. Want to talk about race relations, religion, or politics without being super offensive? Take this class and learn about different cultures, and how to communicate with them in Chinese. Plus, this is the most fun you'll ever have in a class, reward all your hard work in Chinese, take this class.","This course is a great option if you want to keep up your Chinese, but don't have time to devote to one of the other classes. The level of Chinese spoken and taught will depend a lot on the other people who take the class.","The learning environment is relaxed and with a small class, my fluency improved. The topics discussed are also interesting.","This course is actually great for improving your speaking skills (surprise surprise), particularly if you were someone that was always nervous to speak up in previous Chinese classes. It is also nice because you are watching real articles and movies. Also so much less work than any other chinese class ever."

East Asian Languages and Civilizations,CHNSE 166r: Chinese in Humanities,"This course will introduce you extensively to modern Chinese literary traditions. Beware of the intensive pace, however, and the relative shallowness of your understanding of the material.","This was by far the best Chinese class I took at Harvard! It's refreshing to use your Chinese to discuss literature instead of learning new sentence structures every semester. The teacher to student ratio is insane (3 professors for 5 students), both professors were very engaging and super engaged in the course (they organized a conference with Professor Wang's PhD students) and the readings we did were great literature. I really felt like I learned a lot and improved my Chinese. It's a very challenging class, especially if you're fresh out of 140 - be ready for a big time investment. If you're interested in Chinese culture and want a break from the other Chinese language classes, I highly recommend it!","This is an amazing class for anyone interested in challenging themselves to further improve their Chinese, without the rote structure of a traditional language class. Students have the opportunity to engage with a wide selection of modern Chinese literary works, as well as to spend the semester working on an in-depth independent research paper on a topic of their choosing. From focusing on mastering the material, you will undoubtedly find your language skills (especially when it comes to writing and expressing your ideas) naturally improving as well."

It requires you to learn about all the important topics and works in this field--of course it depends on how you define ""important."" The readings are mostly on social, economic, legal, institutional history.","Be prepared for a massive amount of reading. The class itself is great, but the reading is crushing.",This is a very time-consuming class. Students should be aware of this and plan their semester accordingly. I would discourage first-year grad students to take this class. The learning effect will be higher if you are advanced in your PhD studies.

East Asian Languages and Civilizations,EAFM 140: Anime as Global Popular Culture,This class is engaging and presents relevant academic discussion about anime. You can take this as an elective course which covers Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding. I highly recommend it if you've ever found yourself interested in anime.,It's a really fun class that allows you to discuss many social and cultural conditions (about Japan and anime) in-depth with a knowledgeable group of people.,"This class is really fun and has a wonderful environment! The subject material is fascinating and broadens your understanding of anime and Japanese culture. Definitely take this class if you like anime or Japanese culture in any way. Just be ready to read every week. It's not a lot, but it still takes some time.","How often do you get a chance to take a class about anime? Professor Yoda gives well-organized and interesting lectures. You'll sample a broad selection of anime ranging from WWII propaganda animation to the key episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion to surreal scenes of Daicon IV. The workload is rather light, but every assignment is engaging and fun! The CAs are very helpful, and give lots of feedback on the assignment. On top of it all, it satisfies a Gen Ed! Take this class!","This class is really worthwhile to take. However, it is a lot of work. It is not an easy-A class, but if you put in effort into this class, you will get a lot out of it.",Don't be afraid to take this if you haven't watched anime before.,It's super interesting even if you don't know much about anime or Japanese culture!,"This class is a super fun and interesting perspective on anime as a historical genre.  You don't just learn about anime, but you learn about the impact the genre has had on everything from cinema, to marketing, to cultural history.  Take this class!",The material is very interesting and our class was very engaged with the material which lead to great discussions and classes.,Pretty easy class. Take it if you can write.,"Professor Yoda (yes, you get to have a professor named Yoda) is so awesome and cares deeply about the subject. She is able to make the lectures accessible to those new to anime while also making the discussions engaging for those who watch anime/read manga on a regular bases. The TFs are also really nice and give great feedback on essays.","The coures is very interesting, but grading can be ""random"" or hard to understand.",Have a basic understanding of animation before and make sure to do all the reading and attend all the screenings,"If you are interested in anime at all or if you want to learn more about an incredible medium, this course is for you.",Telling people that you're taking Japanese Anime might be a little weird at first.,Possibly my favorite class I've taken at Harvard. And I'm a senior.,"Material can get weird and if you are not into anime, then you can be an outcast in the class.","Use the light work load to think deeply about the material, not an excuse to blow off the class","This class is NOT light or easy, but in the best way possible. The material is brilliant, professor Yoda is brilliant, and you might be surprised what you learn about entertainment and about yourself!",Course is not what you would expect. Be prepared to learn more about the culture behind anime and analyzing elements of animation.,You might not enjoy this class if you are a realist.,This class isn't going to be just watching anime.,An interest in anime (obviously) and postmodern theory is a must.,"This was hands down the best course I've taken at Harvard, and I'm a physics concentrator. You'll see other comments that this course isn't ""just watching TV,"" but I felt Prof. Yoda makes even the more dense scholarship (LaMarre) go down really easily. The readings were fascinating, you watch two hours of anime per week, and if you feel like procrastinating you have an excuse to watch anime ""for class."" The meta discussion on how anime producers and fans view themselves were also really fascinating and fun to learn about.
The essays were some of the easiest I've written because the material was simply enjoyable. The project was really fun if you wanted to put time into it and gelled with your group members (we got along well). I think if you didn't want to spend as much time it was still pretty much fine, I would not recommend that it deter you from the course.
I would also recommend that if you're interested and looking for a show to binge, watch Evangelion and/or Revolutionary Girl Utena (provided both are still on the syllabus). There's a weeklong unit on each and I thought it was really helpful to have seen at least some of the shows beforehand (definitely not necessary, but they're excellent shows anyway).
Great class, you watch anime always, super painless. Do it.","Professor Yoda and the TFs are not only amazing, sweet people but also immensely knowledgable about the subject matter they teach. If you have absolutely any interest in anime at all, you're going to love the course! A good idea might be to get together a group of friends to split the readings up to make the longer ones more manageable, but if you take this class I can almost guarantee it to be one of the best (if not the best) in your schedule."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,EASTD 98b: Junior Tutorial--Japan and the World,"This course is run in an unusual manner: you have a lecture from Professor Pharr, an amazing individual and scholar of Japan, for an hour before transitioning to section. If it was just lecture, I would give the course a 5, or if Professor Pharr taught section it would be a 5. Unfortunately, section pulled it down a lot, though the section leader probably changes year to year, so I would still recommend the course. 

Pluses:
-fascinating range of topics and issues examined (really—I could talk for years about all the interesting problems that Japan faces that the course introduces you to)
-Professor Pharr is incredibly knowledgeable and encouraging
-Lots of support and help while writing the research paper
-Thoughtful feedback on writing

To improve the course, I would cut out the section component and allow Professor Pharr to teach the entire course. It is a bit jarring to weekly have to switch instructors in the middle of each class meeting, especially when they have very different styles. Professor Pharr is frankly more knowledgeable about the subjects than a teaching fellow could be, and I would love to see future classes be taught entirely by her.

Section, as I said, was unfortunately a letdown. Though I felt we had some good discussions, there was little direction and I felt like we often rambled. Additionally, there was not much enthusiasm put into the section and I felt like the energy came more from the students than from the instructor.  The students were great and very interested in the material, which made it bearable most of the time.

Overall though, it's a good course, but it was frustrating that its incredible potential was brought down by section.

I learned about many of the societal, historical, and political issues that modern Japan faces. These will inform me as I continue my study of East Asia and have definitely shaped the way I approach the region. 

I also worked on my social science writing, with which I did not have much prior experience. I am grateful for the feedback I received, which was thoughtful and helpful.",The TF will truly dictate how a student's experience will be. Prof. Pharr is a guaranteed 5,"Professor Pharr is a fantastic teacher, and this course is an excellent overview of very current issues in the social scientific study of Japan!",This is definitely a course for anyone who wants to learn more about Japanese issues. It's definitely a lot of reading but each one is relevant to the topic. You also connect all the readings through short papers throughout the semester. But this class will take a lot of time if you really want to do well and participate.,"Even if you are only moderately interested in East Asia or Japan, take this course, because Professor Pharr is an effective lecturer and an amazing professor get to know personally. You will definitely have fun learning so much (breadth and depth) about a single nation."

The texts you read are fascinating and may make you want to live your life differently. Professor Abe is probably the most accessible and kindest professors that I've worked with here, and he has incredible wisdom to share with the class. Take it if you have any interest in East Asian religions or you want to think critically about how you live.",This class is an absolute gem! Professor Abe crafts an intellectually rewarding experience for each of his students.,"Professor Abe is amazing; this course is transformative. It'll challenge the way you think, and stimulate you to ponder about the way you live your life.","I would strongly encourage anyone with any interest in the subject matter (or hoping just to learn a little bit) to take this course. The books are presented in a way that really makes you think about their meaning through great class discussion. The small class size also leads to everyone getting to talk plenty, and you don't feel pressured to speak or not speak in the class. Professor Abe is the nicest professor, and he really cares both about his students and about what he's talking about. He's passionate, and you can't help feel passionate about the subject matter as well. Reading fiction at the end of the course was also a great change from previous courses I've took, and not having to analyze it like an English text and instead reading it for the impact it has on you personally causes you to realize that you can derive plenty of knowledge, whether academic, intellectual, or personal, when you actually enjoy a book rather than just study it. I applaud Professor Abe for helping me re-realize this.","I took this class because I heard great things about it, and I was excited to discover classes that I would remember for the rest of my life. I also wanted to dedicate time during the week to relax and read books that I was interested in. This class took a few weeks for me to really settle into, but by the end, I was amazed at how thoughtful and interesting our conversations were. I am so glad to have gotten to know Professor Abe and to have learned more about Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism and much much more of course.",best class at Harvard.,"I really hope Prof. Abe teaches this course again! I'm not a humanities person and definitely not EAS, but this course was well worth the novel-a-week reading schedule. You also learn a lot about yourself in the process, and get to reflect on that in a final project of your choosing. A high quality gem that shouldn't be missed."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,JAPAN Ba: Elementary Japanese,"Very rewarding, Japanese is awesome!","This class is wonderful! The language is amazing on its own, but the way Kageyama sensei teaches makes it so much better. While it may seem hard at first, it will get more manageable. Just be sure to participate in class, don't be afraid to speak up. Making mistakes is a huge part of learning and they understand this. The drill sections are also incredibly helpful because they make you speak in Japanese. This seem intimidating, but its extremely helpful in developing fluency.","Make sure to memorize vocabulary early, and practice it often, as it does not go away.","This is a fantastic introduction to Japanese, and you'll be surprised at how much you learn in just one semester. The teachers are all very dedicated and patient. I would recommend this class without reservation if you're at all interested in learning Japanese.","There's a fair amount of busywork. It's not a uniquely wonderful class, but it's solid, and it isn't devastatingly difficult. As with all language classes, if you want to learn the language - go for it!","Great language introductory course, worth taking whether interested in Japan or not to begin with.",It's hard but worthwhile. You come out with a surprising amount of Japanese language knowledge.,Japanese is not well taught at Harvard. Take another language.,"This is a great opportunity, and apanese is a very fun and satisfying kanguage.",Japanese is an incredibly fun and beautiful language to learn and you will see yourself make an incredible amount of progress throughout this course.  The program is excellent and you will find yourself a part of an amazing community that you never knew existed.,Kageyama sensei is the best,"It's a great class with fantastic teachers, but it is incredibly fast paced. While you will learn a lot and have a lot of fun, they should learn rudimentary Japanese before hand.It will make the class much easier.",They want you to learn the language and are always willing to help. You can really learn a lot if you put the work into it.,"I really enjoyed this class - I felt like my teachers were dedicated to helping us learn, and I made some really great friends too!","Japanese Ba may be one of the best courses at Harvard. Kageyama-sensei and the drill instructor are great at explaining the language, and you will definitely have enough support to learn the material. There is so much that you learn, that you will actually be surprised by how much Japanese you will know by the end of the semester!","It's a great class to learn a new language. The TFs are wonderful, and Kageyama sensee is great as well. I really enjoyed the class.","If you have any interest in learning Japanese, I highly suggest you do it here. The teaching staff is amazing and infinitely available outside of class for extra help. There is class and homework every day, and on average, 2 short quizzes per week, but don't let this daunt you! You likely won't need to spend much more than 5-6 hours per week outside of class on this course. If you put in the effort to prepare for class every day, you'll do very well, and likely come out with an understanding of Japanese language and culture that surprises you.",It's a good class.,"If you would like to learn a new language, and are prepared to spend a lot of time on it, I would definitely recommend this course. Although it was probably my hardest course, I learned so much. The teachers are also wonderful.","This will be the best taught class you've had at Harvard. I cannot be more grateful to the dedication of the senseis in all that they do. You'll learn so much so quickly, and retain it very very well! Use the senseis as resources because they'll make themselves consistently available to help you in any way you need. The class feels like a community where you're all learning as a team, which has brought me great friends along the way too. TAKE THIS CLASS!",this class is really great,Really fun and fast class that has a steady workload,"i have already told them: do it, but be prepared.","I think that you will sincerely regret not taking Japanese Ba if you are considering it. I have taken another East Asian Language before (Chinese my freshman year) and comparing Japanese class to Chinese class, I find Japanese to be very well organized and very accessible. I found Kageyama-sensei to be a sincere and genuine teacher who was willing to help her students succeed any way she saw possible. She is a talented preceptor and I think the two TFs were amazing as well. The whole team is so friendly and kind. You get so much out of this class as well, I have learned so much writing, speaking, listening, and reading skills that I am genuinely excited to take Japanese Bb next year and for the years following.

Definitely consider taking it!","This class is awesome. If you're choosing among several languages to pursue, and you're remotely interested in Japanese, I strongly suggest checking out the course in shopping period and most likely you'll end up taking it. Incredibly well-organized and dedicated professor and instructors."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,JAPAN 106a: Classical Japanese
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,JAPAN 120a: Intermediate Japanese I,"Definitely take this course if you've already taken Ba and Bb. It is definitely much more difficult than Ba or Bb, but it's completely worth it and you'll learn so much more in 120 than you already did in B-levels.",This class is so much fun! But you learn a lot too!,This class helps you get a greater understanding of more complex grammar points. I feel that my speaking and writing capabilities definitely increased over the course of the semester. Be sure to review all Kanji learned!.,Shingu sensei is great. She really cares about her students and puts a lot of effort into making sure lectures and assignments are on point.,"Demanding but rewarding. Shingu-sensei and Nishimura-sensei put their hearts into the course, and it shows in the course material and assignment feedback. Be prepared to work hard and not fall behind, but this class will make your Japanese improve by a ridiculous amount!","Extremely well taught. I have also taken Chinese here at Harvard, but hands down Japanese is taught better. It focuses on few grammar points and drill them into your head.",A bigger time commitment than Jpn Bb/Ba but do continue taking Japanese as you will improve so much.,"This class is great, but pretty challenging. Meeting 5 days a week, you really don't get a break from Japanese till the semester is over. However, your Japanese will GREATLY improve by the end.",Second year may appear as a leap from first year in terms of difficulty. More efforts are expected.,"There is a high workload and fast pace, but you will learn a lot and improve your Japanese immensely.","I loved this course. A lot. If you like the language, and care about the culture, and are willing to put the work in, it's fantastic. The teachers are supportive and the occasional confusion definitely bonds the students together.","This is simply an amazing course! Shingu-sensei and Nishimura-sensei are absolutely dedicated to teaching and are always ready to help. Even if you need help on something not directly related to a lesson, they're always available by email or at their office hours. I know I spent many of mine having discussions with them on various topics for the practice. It's a good amount of work, but totally worth it in the end. My Japanese has improved tremendously thanks to both of them!"
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,JAPAN 130a: Intermediate Japanese II,You will regret not learning Japanese at Harvard because it is such a well-run program. I've learned more than I ever could have self-teaching (which would've probably failed miserably). I can understand snippets of real-life speed conversations in the media and make out basic news articles!,"The course is enjoyable!
I came into the course after doing PII over the summer--so jumping from first year to third year.  And I have to say, it is quite a jump!  
If you are thinking of skipping into 3rd year, you MUST buy and study Shingu sensei (2nd year sensei)'s textbook.  Study the kanji, and brush up on small bits of grammar that may be different from PII/HIF/KCJS.  
If you do that, the first three weeks are far less of a struggle bus.

As for the class, Yagi-sensei is cool and Maekawa-sensei is very nice--the class is well organized and while there is a lot of homework, it definitely improves your writing and reading skills a ton.","-Lots of interesting material covered that you wouldn't otherwise be able to tackle in Japanese. 
-Instructors are ready to help you when you need it. 
-Very challenging but this makes it rewarding.
-Relative for real world interactions and readings in Japanese.

If students do not this course to be exceedingly difficult (which it was for me), students need to have all the kanji/vocab/grammer from Ba/Bb and 120a/b MEMORIZED well. If not, you will struggle though you can get through. Especially if you are coming off a summer doing second year abroad, make sure you put in A LOT of time memorizing all of the 120a/b material.

On the whole, I'm very happy I took the course. My Japanese has improved a lot and I am much more confident in my ability to work through Japanese texts.",It is just a lot of work which makes the student face the fact that advanced language courses are not relaxing course but rather pretty stressful and demanding ones.,"This is definitely a step up from 120. If you are sure you want to continue learning Japanese, definitely take the course because it teaches you a lot.",This class really helped by allowing us to engage with articles and improve our argumentation skills in Japanese through our discussions in the first and third units. Yagi-sensei also delivers the material in an easy-to-follow way and helps with overall reviews at the end of grammar lectures. Maekawa-sensei's sections also helped immensely by having us practice each unit's grammar structures and showing us just how many different structures can be applied to similar situations.,Yagi-sensei is a hilarious teacher!,study study study. lots of reading. dont let the first 3 weeks stop you from taking the course. It gets better. or at least you get used to it.,"You know this class is in the Japanese department and thus you know it will be nothing but exceptional. Yagi-sensei and Maekawa-sensei are absolutely the best and I know that my Japanese improved tremendously because of their guidance. They are both talented and caring teachers, as well as being very cool to just talk to outside of class because they're always available. I have no criticisms for this gem of a class. You not only learn more grammar and vocabulary but you get to apply them in real discussions about real issues."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,JAPAN 140a: Advanced Modern Japanese,"It's a fantastic course that really helps you with your conversational and formal speaking skills. Highly recommended if you want to advance your Japanese studies, whether as an elective or part of your concentration requirements.","Teachers are excellent, class is engaging but sometimes the disparate nature of the material makes it hard to gauge if one is making progress.","Japanese 140a is all about reading comprehension. There will be speeches, presentations, and compositions (TONS OF THEM) so prepare yourself for A LOT of work. It should be easier on you if you work hard but if you haven't the time or the natural ability to read kanji on the fly like I did, then this course will take a very big chunk of your time.","If you've taken previous Japanese courses, you know the drill by now. This one has more work than prior courses but follows the same basic structure."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,JAPAN 150a: Readings and Discussion in Japanese Social Sciences,"A fantastic course. The focus on readings (as opposed to quizzes on grammar/vocab/kanji) makes it very enjoyable and interesting. Discussing interpretations of the readings with classmates was a lot of fun, too :).

Also, can we have more debates? Those were a lot of fun :)."

As a student with no prior experience in Japanese literature beyond a very area-specific set of texts, this course was marvelous. Joanna is an incredible instructor, empathetic and very knowledgeable, and the students enrolled in the course are contagious in their passion for Japanese history and culture. Even those with little or no background in Japanese lit will find Japan Lit 140 an excellent opportunity to read widely and be exposed to many critical authors in the last century of published protest fiction."

As long as you can understand and speak a little Korean take it. It is easily the most fun class I've had at Harvard, and the teacher takes you out for lunch after the final.","Bxa is a great course that delves into all of the right foundations of the Korean language. It is perfectly tailored for those who have listened to Korean all of their lives, but never were able to speak it properly. The class's format is very well structured and classes become something you want to go to rather than a chore. Note that there's no shortcut to assignments and they do take a good amount of time. However, they are far from difficult and do well in reinforcing the material learned in class.",Korean Bxa moves quickly

East Asian Languages and Civilizations,KOREAN 130a: Pre-advanced Korean,Be prepared to study almost every day!,"This course is much more difficult than Korean 120, so just be prepared to make much more effort in studying and preparing for this class.","The class material is a huge step up from Korean 120, but because of that, the learning environment is less encouraging and helpful for second-language-learners."

East Asian Languages and Civilizations,MANCHU A: Elementary Manchu,Very enjoyable class especially if you are interested in using Manchu academically. Beware te script is quite difficult at first but you will get used to it.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,UYGHUR 120A: Intermediate/Advanced Uyghur
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,VIETNAM Ba: Elementary Vietnamese,"Take this course if you are strongly interested in learning vietanmese language and its culture. But do know that it is not an easy class, you probably need to spend around 7-8 hours a week for this course and the class time might be quite demanding. Also, the classroom environment can be quite different from other classes."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,VIETNAM 120a: Intermediate Vietnamese,"If you want to learn Vietnamese, definitely take this course. We learned so much more than just the language, and the professor is very knowledgeable about all aspects of Vietnam. However, to enjoy this course, you must be really committed to learning the language and work hard."
East Asian Languages and Civilizations,VIETNAM 130a: Advanced Vietnamese
Economics,ECON 10a: Principles of Economics,Do problem sets early.,we need more mankiw lectures,"This class is manageable. The material may not be the most interesting, but it's necessary to learn if you are going to concentrate in econ. I was actually surprised by the volume of information I learned about micro  by the end of the semester. The information really starts to click a few weeks into the course. The psets can be tricky but you can get them done fairly easily if you go to office hours. You will do well on exams (they are heavily curved) if you take the time to study and understand all of the concepts. Take this class if you are really interested in econ or are going to concentrate in econ; however, don't take this as an easy gen ed as the course does require a good deal of work.",Choose a good section leader.,"This course can be helpful to develop economic literacy which can ultimately shift the way you look at the world. However, you should take this course seriously and complete the readings. You get as much out of Ec10 as you put in.",This is a good foundational course in economics.,"Do not shy away from Ec10 just because you have heard horror stories about it, but also do not take it unless you have a genuine interest in the material, otherwise you will be pretty miserable for a semester.","Ec 10 is the only introductory economics class offered at Harvard, so take it if you want to use economics in the future. However, take everything that you learn in the class with a grain of salt. Understand that the course offers a biased sample of microeconomic thinking, and claims objectivity for extremely subjective statements.

Students who take Professor Mankiw on his word will leave the class believing it to be simple economic fact that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment or that the Laffer Curve has real-world implications when there is not anything close to consensus on these ideas within the economic community. The course teaches a philosophy that values profit over people and uses a logic of generalized assumptions backed up by little concrete data.","Interesting material. There's definitely a conservative spin on some of the material, but take it with a grain of salt and remember that it's just the most basic principles and ignores many of the real-world issues. Mathematical sophistication is basically non-existent, and if you've taken calculus before you'll likely be hitting yourself over the head by how simple the math is. Psets are by far the most difficult part of the class. The only thing you should watch out for is that exams will have questions about the most random facts from lecture so be prepared for that.",Go to office hours if you're confused.,"Try not to get too caught up in the terms and definitions in the textbook; a better way to approach the course material is to think about the ""how"" and ""why"" of the big concepts, as well as how each of the concepts relates to each other.","This class is very important to be a knowledgable citizen, but it should absolutely be two gen eds for both semesters.","It was a great class, especially if one takes advantage of opportunities such as office hours to make the most out of the course.",Whether you like Ec or not and your success in the course all depends on your TF. Simple enough.,"Whether you will like Econ 10a depends on two things:
1. Whether you have a good TF (which is pure luck -- although some switching is allowed)
2. Whether you naturally like economics 
The course isn't set up in a way that it makes economics interesting for people who wouldn't normally find it so -- only take this class if you actually like economics.",Go to David Johnson's' office hours. It will change your life. He is beyond amazing.,didn't love it,"I thought this was a great course. It really increased my understanding of economics. Just to give a little background, I'm a sophomore with absolutely no econ experience and I found the course to be both easy and really manageable. The problem sets were not time intensive or particularly difficult. I didn't have much time to study for the exams, but really all you have to do is spend some time on the practice exam materials. Naturally, due to the nature of the course, it all depends on your section leader.","This class is boring and slow. If you took AP Economics in high school, SKIP THIS CLASS. Try at any cost to get into 1010a. Furthermore, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. They have a captive audience in that you have to take this course to take other ec courses which is a shame because this class is so impersonal, scripted, and uninteresting.","This class is taught very effectively and efficiently, and if the resources that this course provides are taken full advantage of, then a student will have a great understanding of microeconomics when the course terminates.",Take this class or you're not an informed citizen.,"If you know the math, you'll be extremely bored, but still get the intuition.",Ec10 was a lot of fun for me. Your experience will depend a lot on your TF and if you keep up with the readings. You will struggle if you try to just go to section because they don't cover everything in the textbook.,"It's EC10a, you can't not take it because it's requirement. So it's as enjoyable as a good required course, but certainly not an elective. Mankiw is the worst - pray for a good TF.","Ec10 is really worth taking. If you work hard and have a good section leader, you will be able to do well. The exams are very reasonable and not worth stressing about. You will be well prepared if you pay attention in section. There's always some material in the lectures that gets tested on the exams, so they're absolutely worth going to, not to mention that some of the lectures are by very prominent economists. Ec10a is a great way to knock out a gen ed requirement and see if economics is of interest to you.",I believe that all students should take this course to have an understanding of economics,It's a great class that teaches you a lot.,"There is a reason that this course is the most widely attended course at Harvard. The material does the job, though you could likely learn it through the text book rather than in class. Either way, I recommend taking the course and attending the lectures to gain from the material.","I took this course as an elective, and I am glad I took it because I think it helped me understand a basic level of how markets work. The workload isn't too bad, and there's help available. I've also heard that Ec 10b is something better suited for real-world applications, which is something to keep in mind.","I feel like how much you'll take out of this course is largely dependent on the quality of your TF.  I had a great TF, so I enjoyed the class, but I know others who feel differently.","Great intro to economics class--came in without ever taking any classes in econ, and feel that I have gained a lot from Ec10. The experience really depends on your section leader, though","Be careful before you enroll in this course. Everyone is taking it, but that does NOT mean you should. If you have a bad TF (like I did) then you will struggle with the exams. This may not be because you don't understand the material, but rather is a result of the fact that the exams are designed to be tricky. Without helpful hints from a TF you will likely struggle.",I actually wish this class becomes a General Education requirement. It develops a more critical lens in policy and it really is effective for all disciplines.,"Take this class if it is a requirement for a concentration or want to take more advanced economics, but it is such a basic look at economics that if you are just looking to understand economics it provides such an idealized look at the system that is not entirely applicable to the real world.","Ec 10 is a solid class that equips you with the basic tools of economics while at the same time teaching you concepts that are relatable to real life. Also, David Johnson is an amazing teacher and it is so sad that he will be leaving. When I was preparing to take Ec. 10, I asked people who had taken it before for advice and they kept on hammering ""Go to David Johnson's office hours"". I didn't understand what that meant until I actually went to Office Hours. All the concepts that I struggled to understand in section became so much more clearer.","Your mileage with this class depends heavily on your section.

Lots of times, the concepts covered in section don't necessarily convert well to understanding and completing the psets.",Everyone should know a little bit about how scarce resources are allocated.,Honestly the experience really varies with the TF you get. I'd recommend talking to your friends and trying to get a TF they recommend because some of them are just straight awful from what I've heard.,"This is a challenging class, especially if you haven't taken micro before, which many of the people taking the class have.  But, you learn a ton and will be a better informed citizen and voter.",Good material for everybody to have an understanding of.,Be ready to work a lot on problem sets and to integrate concepts that typically aren't related to one another in high school economics.,"As long as you stay on top of your time management and understanding of what is being taught, this class is an incredibly interesting and rewarding class to take.",Gives a great overview of microeconomics,"This course has a lot of potential. The material is interesting, and I've definitely left with a different perspective on key economic issues such as the minimum wage and the carbon tax. However, I found section to be basically be a boring summation of the textbook, problem sets were tedious, and the exams asked very specific unfair questions from lectures. The material is great, but it's just delivered poorly. Mankiw, the ""professor"" is inacessible and holds office hours randomly and infrequently. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have taken this class, but with a little reform, it could have been much better","If you've already taken AP and done well, this class should be easy, but still interesting.","At times it may seem frustrating and you may be cursing Mankiw for lecturing so little, but at the end of the day it teaches you what you need to know, and you need to know the material and understand basic economics to understand our world and be an informed citizen.","It is a really good class, only reservation is that your section leaders can really impact how much you learn. Go to Johnson's office hours and make sure to take the unit tests.","This class provides theoretical foundations to analyze incentives and choices, and their effects on consumers and producers alike.","Be prepared, lots of reading",lot of work but worth it,it is very annoying and difficult but it is worth it if you have a passion for economics,"Solid introductory economics class that's light on lectures, heavy on sections.","Make sure to get a good TF, or find a better one to ask about psets; it's a huge class so stick up for yourself!!!","Ec 10a is a challenging course, but it is manageable if your keep up with the textbook readings. Additionally, if you have a background in microeconomics (high school AP level), you should be very confident in your ability to succeed in this course.","Try to stay on top of your work, if you get behind you will have trouble","Having a good TF will influence greatly how interested you will be in the subject. With head TF David Johnson leaving next year, one might be more wary as to how the course will be.","Even if not required, this class is a great way to get a basic education in economics that will help you be a more informed citizen.","This is one of the largest courses at Harvard that all students seem to take at one point or another, so I do think it's important to take this course for the solid foundation of microeconomic theory that it will give you. Ultimately, it's a manageable course if you study hard and manage your time well, and you will get a lot out of it if you do all the readings and psets!","Ec10a is a great class and a great intro to the field of economics. The key to having a good experience with this class is getting a good TF, and I was lucky enough to get Stephanie. If you keep up with the material and the readings, it is not a difficult class, but it is very easy to get behind.","It's not great being taught almost exclusively by TF's. If you're interested in economics though, you kind of have to take it.","Even if you're not planning to do anything related to econ, this is a valuable course to take because of how applicable it is to daily life. The material is quite interesting, and it pushes you to look at the world through a different lens, which I personally found exciting. The problem sets can sometimes be quite a bit of work, but it helps to work with people.",don't take it unless you need to,The average grade in this class is a B+; that does not make this class an easy one by any means.,"It's not particularly fun, but it is foundational. If you don't get a good TF at first, switch at all costs. David Johnson likes to draw test questions from the optional readings.",TF quality varies wildly.,A standard requirement for Ec concentrators but also interesting as an introduction to how markets work for general knowledge.,"Ec10 is a great class overall. It definitely has the potential to help you become a more informed citizen, and every Harvard student should understand basic economics. However, the class experience depends almost solely on your TF and your experience in section. Lecture is definitely a chore, and not much teaching/learning happens during lecture. Section can be an amazing, eye-opening experience, and the psets/exams are all designed for in-depth learning. Even if you got a mediocre TF, David Johnson's office hours and review sessions, which were must-attend, were open to all. Unfortunately, with David Johnson leaving at the end of the 2014-2015 school year, who knows what Ec10 will look like in the future.","That although it may not be the most interesting class, it is necessary if you want to pursue a concentration in economics.",Greg Mankiw is the chillest dude of all time. This class will open your mind.,"Take the unit tests, use the helpful hints posted on the course site, and read the textbook (including the supplemental boxes/asides). Start your psets early so you have time to go to office hours. Know that you aren't restricted to your TF's office hours--you can go to office hours held by other TFs, David Johnson (or the next course head), etc. Understand that Mankiw is conservative and that the course is introductory. You have to wade through the conceptual, foundational material before getting to the interesting real-world or interdisciplinary applications of economics. Some of the lectures do give you a glimpse of what lies ahead.","This course is foolishly taught via sections from often poor TFs rather via than lecture from a good teacher. This is so that Harvard can keep its average class size numbers down, but has a terrible effect on the course by making it inconsistent and inequitable. A horribly run course with great unrealized potential to better inform the views of all those who take it. With the departure of David Johnson I'm afraid it'll only get worse - until they finally realize its worth the statistical hit to just teach via lecture and have everybody learn from a good instructor.",Make sure your ready for the time commitment and know what you are getting into. I really liked the class though and that I can I understand concepts I hear on the news now.,This course is a very good entry into economics to see if you like the subject and wish to pursue it,"I would say that if you're a first-year student looking to take this course because you might be interested in economics, avoid it until sophomore year.  You can definitely still be an economics concentrator without taking it during the fall of your first year.  It is definitely one of the worst courses that I have taken during my time at Harvard, and the only reason I took it was because it was required for my concentration.  Your experience is 100% dependent on your TF, and they vary in quality... a lot.  That said... if you have the time to dedicate to this course including going to office hours and doing all of the unit tests, it isn't too difficult, and you can do well... it just requires a lot of personal effort because the teaching isn't always the best.",You should take it for a basic understanding of the world.,"This is a challenging course, perhaps less so if you have taken Economics in high school. Even if you did, you might learn some new things. Take the optional unit exams, even though they sometimes test on a few topics and concepts that aren't covered in the course textbook, or even in section. The real exams are harder than necessary.",Go to office hours (Especially David Johnson's) and you will understand the course material a lot better.,"Not too painful, probably worth taking for the experience.",Do the readings!,Take this class but be ready to put more time and effort than is asked of you into it if you want to be successful.,"Ec 10 is an essential class. It is not particularly engaging, it is not particularly exciting, and it will probably not succeed in making you love economics. That said, the basic concepts of Microeconomics are important in every field. This class, if nothing else, does a good job of explaining these basic concepts. It is not a class I would take for fun, but it's also not one I would have skipped. The problem sets are doable, the tests are pretty doable as well, and sections aren't terrible (mind you, I had a good section leader) My suggestion is, grit your teeth, accept that you'll want to take it eventually, and get it out of the way freshman year.","If you want to do well in the exams, it would require most of your own initiative by studying the helpful hints and going to office hours.","it's incredibly difficult, like you have to put in a ton of extra time, harder than it seems","If you don't understand something, ABSOLUTELY GET HELP IMMEDIATELY. Every concept builds on the previous concept, and missing any key point will result in you being continually lost as more concepts get piled on which don't make sense. Go to all the office hours you can, you really need it. Bring your psets there, because these psets take forever.",This is a great course to learn the basics of economics.,If you don't love economics it is a challenging course although the applications of theories are interesting,"Hard, but interesting class.",Work hard and it will be rewarding.,"If you've never taken Econ before, this is a great introductory class. If you took AP Econ, micro and/or macro in high school and are debating whether or not to take this course or to take a higher level of econ, take this course. While I didn't really learn much in section, the minimal amount of work and great lectures (however few there are) made this course worth it.",I would definitely recommend that you take this course. It's essential that you learn these theories not for only the class but also for your practical life.,"Ec10 can be a great and extremely informative class, if you are willing to put in the time commitment. I opted to taking the Problem Sets slow because that's just how I learned the material. So someone like me would have to put aside quite some time for this course.","Very interesting, but somewhat difficult because of the teaching style. Make sure you go to office hours.","It's a good course, but your success really has a great deal to do with your proctor.  By success I mean comprehension of the material.",Mankiw never shows up so don't be alarmed.  Pay attention in section.,"This course should not be called Greg Mankiw's course-- the head TF creates and runs the entire course, with Makiw featured a handful of times throughout the semester if you're lucky. His lack of effort/participation in the course is frustrating. It is taught entirely in section.","I took this class as someone who does not intend to concentrate in economics, but wanted to learn the basics in order to help future studies of international relations/to be a good global citizen. While it is a good introductory course in that it is careful not to demand more of students than they would be able to do as beginners in the field, it is a terrible introductory course for someone like me--it doesn't teach a lot of ""real economics"" but rather focuses either on a very shallow overview that is basically just common sense, or on silly details that won't be important or memorable in the long run. The class is also terribly and frustratingly organized, and is overall a bad experience. Don't take this unless you have to for concentration requirements.","PSETs are long and hard and there is a lot of material to cover for exams, if you get a good TF it makes the class much more fun. Go to office hours",Good starting foundation for economics,David Johnson is a god. It is sad that future students won't get him. Make sure to transfer into a good section. Do the psets in a timely fashion and the class isn't that hard. I took as a junior and it was very nice and relatively stress-free,Not very hard to get a good grade if you do the work. The material is all basically intuitive.,"If you have any interest in economics, you'll love this course.","Seriously consider your GPA before you take this class, as you'll see a large drop simply due to the horrible curves on Economics 10a tests.","If you have good mathematical instincts and have taken the AP, you will probably be better off skipping this course. I took this class because I read the AP textbook and took the exams but have never been in an actual economics class. I would suggest shopping the intermediate level class if you're willing to push yourself a little bit harder. 
Go to lectures. Professor Mankiw reiterated a lot of what is in his textbook in the earlier lectures, but the later ones are more engaging. The guest lectures were about interesting topics even though the lecturers might not be the most charismatic. Personally, I was inspired to read several books about startups, behavioral economics, game theory, and welfare reforms after being exposed to some big questions through sections, guest lectures, optional readings, and problem sets.",It's not a difficult class but will require a few periods of intense work.,It is a necessary burden to study economics. Find students to study with!,"It seems like there are two kinds of people who take this class: the ones who find the problem sets difficult but manageable and fun to figure out, and the ones who find the problem sets grueling and the low point of their weeks. This class is I think very necessary in that the general microeconomics principles can be widely applied. However, your enjoyment of the class depends very much upon the quality of your section leader because they are the ones who do the majority of teaching (Mankiw only gives five or six lectures over the course of the semester). For me, all the concepts of the course didn't completely come together until I began studying for the final, mostly because I went to other section leaders as well as because I finally had to break down and teach myself the skills I didn't understand from the section. My advice to anyone who takes this course is to really jump in to it: go to David Johnson's office hours (!!!) and the review sessions of other TFs as well as any office hours you have access to. I found this course incredibly grueling, but if I had employed the same tactics all semester that I did in preparation for the final I think I would have had a greater appreciation for the course.",This course is great! Alot of work definitely but worth it.,"This isn't a particularly engaging class, and so you end up digesting a lot of information, often without learning its implications.","I learned a lot in this course, but you will definitely notice that it is a course designed for 600 students to be able to take and succeed in - there is a very generous curve on most exams. Make sure you pay attention in lecture! There will be lecture questions on exams and if you did not listen, you will not know the answers. Those are points that are not worth losing.","Very challenging for some, for others it comes naturally. If you have taken microeconomics before, I strongly recommend, however, those who have not are frankly a step behind.",It's a challenging class but has the unique property of being useful in the understanding of every day life.,"David Johnson is awesome! Unfortunately he'll be gone by the time next year's students come around, but nonetheless this course is one of the best and most enriching ones I've taken so far at Harvard.",Ec 10a is a great course.  The sections reinforced what we learned on our own from the textbook.  The greatest strengths of this course were the psets and mid-term review materials.  I now feel I have a strong foundation in micro-economics and a new way to look at many current domestic issues.,Stay on top of your readings and stay engaged in all sections and lectures,I would recommend future students pace themselves and work at understanding concepts gradually and not try to cram all at once.,Your TV will make or break your experience; find a good one early on.,"Important if you want to do Ec, or are even thinking about it, but I may not be the greatest experience. Somewhat of a necessary evil",Don't take this class for a Gen Ed. Trust me!,Worth the work,Take it as a sophomore. Seriously.,"The class is very straightforward. Read the textbook, do the problems, go to section and lecture, study and you will make it through. Obviously try your best to get a good TF and when in doubt ask other TFs or David Johnson for help. You will learn a lot and many find the material relevant if not interesting.","The experience is definitely what you make it. It depends on your TF, your willingness to engage in participations and attend lectures and above all, to GO TO DAVID JOHNSTON'S OFFICE HOURS! (HINT: everyone should definitely do it!)",People like to complain about Ec10 but it's better than most people say!,Succeeding in the course requires a large time commitment but it is very rewarding.,"I strongly recommend this class. Ec10, aside from serving as the foundation course for economics, will change how you think about your life and the world and will make you are more effective citizen.
It is a shame that David Johnson is leaving, though, because he literally made the course. I don't know what it will be like without him.
Try to start the PSets early. They tend to take 5-6 hours. They are not deathly difficult, but are certainly time-consuming.
Go to Mankiw's office hours. He is a very cool guy and highly intelligent: you can definitely learn a lot there (both in terms of material and in the way an expert economist structure his thoughts).","If you get basic math and have some common sense, you'll be fine. Just do the readings and stay on top of it and you'll cruise.","Ec10a does a good job of teaching the foundation of economics. However, because the class is taught primarily in section, the teaching is based on your section leader. The class is pretty easy.","This course was extremely difficult for me due to my selected section leader. He was inexperienced and due to this, I had a hard time understanding the concepts. It all comes down to getting lucky. If you have a decent professor, you will do fine in the class.","This is a good gen ed, you should learn about the world and international trade.","Great introductory economics course, but don't hold your breath for Mankiw lectures.","This class is what you make of it. I have heard all levels of praise and criticism for this class and I honestly think it's because your experience in the class really depends on how much effort you put into it. For example, with the problem sets, really try to figure things out yourself. But if you come across a concept you just don't understand, go to office hours!!!! This is key. I honestly do not know how I could have understood some of the problem sets if I had not gone to David Johnson's office hours. Unfortunately, David Johnson won't be returning as Head TF next year, but nevertheless you should always seek help. The resources are there if you are willing to take advantage of them.","Only really take this class if you need to. Mankiw is awful, the textbook is pretty bad, and section is boring.",This class does a good job of teaching the basic knowledge of economics but it's pretty boring if you don't really like the subject matter.,"The problem sets may be challenging,  but they are manageable and essential to your understanding. Also, the application of concepts in problem form is more difficult than one would assume so spend a lot of time practicing and take Unit Exams.",It's a great class if you have no prior experience in economics and are genuinely interested in the field.,"Ec10 is an interesting class. If you are looking to understand the math behind economics, then this is not the class for you.","If you haven't taken ec before, you'll learn a lot.  Make sure you get a good section TF or switch sections until you do, it'll make a huge difference.  The curve is super nice- do average on the exams and take the Unit Tests and you'll get an A-.",It is definitely a good class to take to get a good understanding of economics.,"Can be kinda dull sometimes, but I learned a lot and it's all stuff that you should know before you go out in the real world","This is a great course, I wouldnt recommemend skipping","If you are interested in economics as a potential concentration, take this.  If you are interested in economics more generally (i.e. want to be more economically literate), consider taking this.  Otherwise...not really a ""fun"" class.",make sure to get help from your TF if you've never taken econ before,"its a useful course, but also somewhat rigorous.","Yeah, this class can be somewhat annoying sometimes. But let's face it, economics is important to know in today's world. This class is effective at teaching it, so students should take it. And it's not that bad, the problem sets are gone over in office hours and if you study seriously for the tests you will do fine considering the curve.",Not very good teaching. Have to do a lot of learning independently.,This course build good foundations to do basically anything in any field.,It is very difficult but you learn a lot.,Econ 10 is a great class. Lectures are interesting and topics learned in this course help you better understand policies about the economy,"With David Johnson running the class, Ec10 was incredible. He was so fiercely intelligent and caring about his students and the class. I'm not sure what it will be like without him. Lectures are scarce, and not too informative. Section is completely hit or miss. But you will absolutely learn the principles of microeconomics if you take this course, no matter who the head teaching fellow is. Just beware that the Q guide might not give an accurate reflection of the class because the class' heart and soul, David Johnson, is unfortunately leaving.","Take this class if you are prepared to think independently about the information presented and not to accept every theory as fact. Also, the work load is very manageable.","study lectures, but you don't really need to go","You will learn some economics. You will be frustrated sometimes by the rather dogmatic views held by the Mank. You will take a few exams and do a bunch of problem sets. You'll have more fun elsewhere, but like me, you probably have to take this.","It's a great class. I had a great section TF, so I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot. Lectures vary between being very interesting and quite dull. You won't get taught by Mankiw other than about 4 lectures.","It's very hard, but you will really learn a lot about economics.","Do all the practice problems for the exams, they are challenging, but it is an interesting class","This class is the capitalist machine and they're not even shy about it. Take it
to know how an economist thinks though because that has a lot of utility and the opportunity cost... Oh no. They got to me! Save yourselves!","This class is a pretty standard introduction to micro-economics. It is mostly taught in sections. As long as you go to section and pay attention, you will not feel lost. Go to lectures because while they are not central to the exams, there will be multiple choice questions about them.",This is a wonderful course for people thinking about concentrating economics or not! I recommend you take it to understand the foundation of economics.,"Ec 10a is a good class that could be a phenomenal class. The material is actually quite interesting, and  some of the TF's are very good, but I had a very poor TF experience. From my perspective, I'd have preferred to have David Johnson (who is a phenomenal teacher!) teach the content covered in section, in a lecture format. As for the existing lectures, they're quite interesting!",I could not imagine a more poorly taught course. Section is a complete waste. The material from the book is recited in the same way it was presented originally. Take it if you have to.,"Rather unexpectedly, Ec10a ended up being the course that I learned the most from freshman fall. Ec10a provides a broad introduction to the major concepts in microeconomics. The textbook is really very well-written, and David Johnson, while crazy, is brilliant. If you're interested in learning more about ""the economy"" (which, before I came to Harvard, was an abstract, unclear concept) and how politics is involved in the economy, this is the course for you. It's not hard, but psets can be annoying -- definitely find someone to work with, because it makes the work go faster.","If you've taken AP Microeconomics, take a higher level course because this course will not be challenging nor rewarding. Most of the course will be review. Also, your experience with the course depends highly on the section leader that you get assigned.",Read the book.,"This is a good class to take, regardless if you're planning to concentrate in Economics, since it touches on many microeconomic concepts that are ubiquitous in today's news and debates.","Definitely take this class! Especially if you are interested in politics or public policy. This course is interesting, engaging, and not excessively time-consuming. It is also very relevant to the real world and may give you deeper insight into the world and into economic policies! Would recommend 10/10","I really liked this course-- it gave me very strong foundations on economics. However, I sometimes feel that the TF's are not well prepared and that there is a lack of communication between the course heads and the TF's.",I enjoyed learning the material in this class. Just try to keep on top of things because it's hard to catch up since a lot of the material is cumulative. Go to office hours.,"Good way to get a gen ed out of the way and also it's just good to take ec10 but it was pretty boring. Wasn't that difficult, but a bad TF can really change the course.","If you are interested in economics, but have never taken an economics course before, take this course to see if you might want to pursue the topic in the future.","Take Ec10a! Ec 10a is difficult, but well worth it because the class gives you some critical life skills and information. How much you get out of section depends on how competent your TF is, but it is still possible to do well without a good TF if you spend a lot of time outside of class going over concepts. You'll be in a better position if you've had some preview of microeconomics before taking the class.",This class was a miserable experience. Only take it if you have to.,"Just sit tight and wait till it's over. The skills it provides are necessary to any understanding of economics; with that, though, comes the fact that there are 800 people all in the same boat. Microeconomics is far less interesting than macro, but in order to take the latter, I would recommend the former. Ec10 is type of course that makes many critics of Harvard accuse us of not prioritizing undergraduate studies. Though such a statement is far from the actual truth, my experience with Ec10 is that it is part of a minority of courses whose goals do not include fostering intimate learning.","Take this class! Even if you have no intention of concentrating in economics, this class teaches you the basics of economics that are useful for a better understanding of the basics of our economy",This class is very good especially when you collaborate on the psets. Not only does it offset the workload but it also helps in terms of group learning.,I hope Economics is not about Ec10,"It's not a perfect class at all -- lectures are disappointing and your experience will hugely hinge on your TF. That said, the things you learn in EC10a are things any informed citizen should know. Don't let the imperfect environment in which you learn them deter you.","It's a great course! It is not easy but you learn so much. Economics is important for everyone to study because it is very practical and applicable to everyone's life. It is true, you will probably not see Professor Mankiw often but that's certainly not a negative. Economics really should be taught in small sections because of the nature of the material. Also the guest lectures introduce really interesting more advanced economic topics which helps to put the basics into perspective. This class is definitely worth the work!","I took this class a GenEd, but I now believe that economics will be my concentration. The concepts seem basic, but if you learn and enjoy the material, you can explore a whole range of issues from a different perspective.",Don't take this class if you are interested in Mankiw; he won't really be there. Take this class if you're interested in economics.,"Ec10 is an awesome opportunity to develop a strong base of understanding in economics while also learning to problem solve and think critically. You truly get as much out of this class as you put in, and if you are dedicated to putting in the time and working with the course material, this class will be a very valuable and memorable academic experience for you!","Read the textbook and listen in section, but be prepared to apply the basic concepts strenuously to complete the problem sets. Going to office hours is imperative to success.","As a liberal, did not enjoy the abundance of conservative philosophy embedded in the course or Mankiw himself. I did learn a lot though.",I went from loving the theory of economics to absolutely despising it.,"Do your problem sets early, and go to David Johnson's office hours.","This course probably epitomizes the common belief that at Harvard ""you'll never meet or be taught by a  professor."" Unfortunately, lectures are infrequent and very rare, especially lectures with Mankiw himself. The subject material is interesting, and entirely depends on your section TF. Problem sets take a long time, and if you don't go to office hours I truly don't know how you can complete them successfully, especially since problem solving is not taught in section, and certainly not in lecture.",Good course that teaches you all of the basics on microeconomics that one can then build off of later.,Great for those who never took Ec and are interested in the material/ want something resembling some sort of business class. A good TF is key and the curve is generous.,"If you can get Josh Bookin as a TF, you will be set. Even though Ec10 as a class is prone to making you feel anonymous, he takes the time to not only learn everyone's name, but also is incredibly open and helpful both in and outside of section. He's an incredible teacher who made the material (which at times was very hard to understand at first) quite accessible.","The tests and Psets are well written but the sections and the way the course is taught, from a textbook is not the most engaging or genuinely interesting way",Take it seriously and it wont be too hard.,Entirely depends on how good your section leader is. I worry for this course after David Johnson has left.,Greg Mankiw,"Economics is a vast and fascinating field, and this course introduces you to many important concepts. However, since the class is so huge, it often feels impersonal and somewhat rushed. You learn mostly from Unit tests and P-sets, which can be very time consuming.","This class is all about your TF, so do your best to get into a good TF's section. David Johnson is unfortunately leaving Harvard, so I'm not sure who the best TF will be. However, if you're hesitant at all about your TF during the first week or two, don't be afraid to switch because that will make all the difference as the semester wears on and the material gets more complicated.","Doing the reading from Mankiw's book will help you! Many students don't bother to do it, and could have benefited from it.",Go to David Johnson's office hours.,"While this class is a great one to take as a freshman due to it's introductory approach to the concepts of economics and the manageable workload, I would caution that anyone without any prior knowledge of economics may find themselves struggling slightly.",It makes you think in a different and useful way that will be helpful to your future and present life.,- one's Ec 10 experience depends on how much work one is willing to put in,It's a grind but it will inform the way you think about the world.,"Ec10 is a great class with a ton of resources to absorb the curriculum if you stay on top of the work and take advantage of those resources (office hours, unit tests, helpful hints, etc.). You have to be more actively engaged in the class than you might think (from the large lectures and section sizes)- it's a very individual experience and about how much initiative you take to use the course's resources.","If you take this class, get ready to put in work! This class can come with frustrations and I recommend that you do not take it with two problem-set classes. Go to section, ask multiple TFs for help (not just yours), work on it with friends, read/skim the textbook, read study guides, take advantage of the helpful hints... JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO EVERYTHING TO NOT FALL BEHIND IN THIS COURSE! Because the process of catching up is not fun.",It is a solid class and teaches a great basis of economic theory.,Very useful foundational course.,"This course isn't that interesting, but it is necessary to have an understanding of the fundamental concepts in economics before one goes on to higher-level courses.","After taking this class, you will have a solid understanding of basic economics. How much individual work you need to put in to achieve this is somewhat determined by how helpful/prepared your TF is during classes and office hours. The problem sets are fairly hard, but if you go to office hours for help they are much more manageable. The unit-test program is amazing and you should take advantage of it.","This is a difficult course.  However, I came out with a much better understanding of economics.  (Although my previous knowledge was non-existent.)","This isn't an ""easy"" class, but if you put the time in it can be very rewarding.",This class is a good introduction to economics. it is helpful is you have a background in economics first though. Make sure you ask a lot of questions and do practice questions!!,"Do the unit tests, they really help you make sure you understand the material and stay on top of things. Plus the extra grade boost is nice. One nice part about the psets is that there are always a bunch of people working on them so you always have friends you can ask. Don't work on psets alone!! Friends make it easier and more fun.","If you have no experience in economics, this is the course to take to learn about the subject.",Very questionable section teaching and lecture material is tested but can learned from reading slides so lectures are not worth going to (Cutler and Laibson are great though).,Do not fall behind,"To take this class, you have to be ready to dedicate substantial time to the thorough completion of readings and problem sets. However, the course material is very interesting, and all of the TFs are very accessible and very willing to answer any questions you have. If you take the time to understand the concepts, the exams, although difficult, are manageable. I highly recommend this course!!",really depends on the TF you get,"I loved the class, I had never done anything like economics before and thought it was fascinating. Don't listen to the people who say they didn't like it!","Take it if you have to, I suppose.","Ec10a and Ec10b are very useful classes if you desire to be an informed citizen. While 10a can seem like an oversimplification at times, it (along with Ec10b) gives students some critical basic economics knowledge. Make sure you have a good TF - if you do not, switch immediately.",This class sucks. The section leaders for the most part aren't able to teach. Mankiw is snobby and racist and teh guest lecturers were no better.,It's necessary for a lot of things. Just gotta deal with it. Not too bad if your section leader is good.,"If you have the right section leader, this course could be extremely enjoyable.","Good introduction to Microeconomics, but nothing too exciting. The class is definitely dry but it teaches you everything you need to know to decide whether or not you want to concentrate in Economics.",many people just have to take ec to get a secondary or concentrate in it. If you are not doing one of those two do not take it,"I think one thing you need to realize with this class is that it is suited for those who have taken econ before. It does not mean that it makes this course easier if you do have a background, but it means be prepared to work very hard. This course is not easy, especially if economics does not come naturally. Don't hesitate to go to your TF's office hours or another TF's hours. Also, don't hesitate to find a tutor. Honestly, don't worry if you do bad on your tests. There is a curve and many opportunities for you to get help. However, if you feel like after one semester the class isn't for you that is totally okay.","How much you end up learning from this class completely depends on the caliber of your TF. Pray for a knowledgable TF come sectioning time! The guest lecturers tend to be very interesting, informative, and related to relavant social/economic issues. Mankiw's lecture are not as exciting.",Ec 10 will teach you how to think in a new way and look at the world differently,It was a very interesting and enjoyable class and a great introduction to microeconomics,The content presented is very good and provides a good introduction to economics. Your experience will most likely depend on what section you are placed into as the content is entirely taught in section. If you haven't taken economics before I would be prepared to do some additional study each week.,"As a sophomore in ec10, I really enjoyed it.  It's straightforward, it's manageable, and it's interesting.  There is no confusion around what is expected of you, and there are no surprises in ec10.  There are many resources available in ec10: varied office hours and unit tests are especially helpful.  Take it!  Even if you aren't planning on concentrating in economics, it's a good class to have taken.","Even though the course instructor is professor Mankiw, you do not see him more than three times, therefore I recommend you to resection immediately if you are not satisfied with your TF's performance, since your liking of the course is very dependent on your TF's way of teaching. I was not content with my TF, Jay Weng, at all, which made the course very disappointing for me. Overall the material of the course generates a good understanding of the neoclassical economic systems which play a very significant role in understanding how the world works today. The PSets are very long and time consuming, so be prepared for long nights working on Econ.","I only took Ec10 because it's required for my possible concentration. I thought that I would hate it, so I wanted to get my one semester of econ out of the way as soon as possible. Turns out, I really enjoyed it! Will be back for more with Ec10b in the spring. It's very logical and intuitive, and it can be very rewarding to gain insights on so many aspects that affect the world around us. Lectures are boring and pretty unnecessary, except for some excellent guest lecturers, but if you have an engaging TF, the material can be really interesting and not too challenging.","This course is well taught and well organized. How difficult you will find it depends a lot on your experience with logic and your math ability. You don't need a lot of math, but you need to be proficient at algebra, otherwise this course will seem very difficult.",Decent amount of work but very rewarding!,take it if want to do ec,Read the textbook.,If you take this class don't take it because you think the great Greg Mankiw will be teaching it! He has nothing (I wish i could bold that) to do with the actual course.,"Even though I took it because it is a requirement for economics concentrators, I would definitely recommend it as an elective or for Gen Ed credit. It's a really good class to get a thorough understanding of the basis of economics. It also gives you a different way of thinking about the world.",Pay attention in section and do the unit tests!,"Mankiw hardly lectures, unfair grading system, unrealistically hard problem sets, learned a lot though",Studying for tests doesn't seem to help grades as much as it should.,Difficult but does give you an understanding that is useful in everyday life.,Read the textbook because TFs and section are not particularly helpful. Lectures and extra readings are not relatively important for exams.,"It's definitely interesting from a non-concentrator point of view. However, it is a very time-consuming class and the material is often a little difficult.","If your section leader is bad, switch, it makes all the difference. Use the helpful hints, they and the problem sets will get you used to the way test questions are asked--same flow/format etc.",This class was very informative overall.,Ask someone for a PDF version of an older version of the textbook. The price of the current edition is outrageous.,"Taking this course is a great way to find out if you are interested in economics. If you have taken AP Economics in high school, most of the material in this course will be a review, but I still recommend taking it because of the emphasis that this course places on math rather than on concepts.",It is a great way of learning how the world is run.,Take it if you are interested in econ at all. Can be boring and difficult but it is clear that the ideas apply to the real world as evidenced in lectures.,Its really hard and very stressful,Basically your performance is tied with your TF's performance.,This class is an introductory ec class. If I could go back I probably wouldn't take this course again but I don't know. Everyone should take some introductory economics.,People often have negative views about Ec 10a but I honestly think it is a close that is worth taking. You get out of it what you put into it and if you put in the time it is a very rewarding class.,It's not that interesting. Kind of generic.,"Ec10a is a course that applies to multiple fields and provides you with a strong foundation for Ec10b and beyond, so you will find that this course will help you a lot in the future. I advise that you always attend the lectures and read the textbook to get the most out of it. The course is designed for those who havn't taken economics before, but if you have already taken it in high school, then that knowledge would be useful background for you.","It might seem easy in the beginning but make sure you keep paying attention because it gets significantly harder. Also, go to the unit tests. Even if you don't know anything, going over them is really helpful and will help prepare you for the exams. Read the book, it makes things so much easier.",It's the big intro ec class - important for any potential ec concentrators to take.  You have to put in the work to do well but it's not too hard to do well. Make sure you study a lot for the 2nd midterm because it's much harder than the first.,"Very boring material. Most likely due to the tf I had, and I had friends who said their tfs did a great job. So how much you like the class will absolutely depend on the tf you have.","Just about everyone winds up taking Ec10 at some point, and though the course is flawed, it still manages to convey the basic principles of the field.  Since the world basically runs on economics, this course will help you to be a functional citizen.  But you're not going to enjoy it unless you're a soulless libertarian robot.",The course takes a lot of work. The more interested you are in course material and connect it with real life problems the easier course gets.,"Take this course if you're interested in ec -- you kind of have to. As a gen ed it wouldn't be a bad course, though maybe more work than necessary and it can be dry. Don't take it for Mankiw because he only lectures a few times. Also buy the old edition textbook, it's the same as the new one and it's $300 cheaper.",It's a standard intro to economics course. They teach you a lot of stuff in terms of graphs and lines and algebra.,"Good intro class to take if you're an economics concentrator, but be prepared for a lot of self-teaching",If you want to broaden your perspective on politics take this course.,This course will help one understand important and fundamental economic concepts. It encourages one to use a variety of approaches in the pursuit of this knowledge. It is fun while being interesting at the same time.,"Mankiw is a character.  If anything, take the course for him.  Entertaining and informative.",It's a class every student should take,Read the textbook before section as you go. It would make studying for midterms and the final much easier. Go to office hours!!!!,"If you don't have an understanding of economics going into the course, this course is difficult and poorly structured.  Also it's hard to imagine anyone truly enjoying the course with any tf other than David Johnson.","This class can be great if you get a good section teacher. If not, it can be pretty frustrating, but still good. Lectures, however, are very good and interesting. Also the textbook is very straightforward.","This is a good course for anyone looking to get a better understanding of how the US and world economies work. As an introduction course, however, it only skates on the surface of a lot of interesting topics. The class is also very manageable in terms of time and difficulty. Your experience in the course depends a lot on what TF you get for section, so if your TF isn't great, I'd recommend switching early on.",Keep up with the readings.,Pay attention to lectures.,It's a worthwhile course.  You have to take the initiative to go to OH and take unit tests if you (1) have a poor TF and (2) want to do well in the course.,"It's useful, no doubt, but in the same way that eating spinach and broccoli is useful when you're growing up: in hindsight, you're glad you got that fiber, but it could've been shoved down your throat in a much more palatable way.",Always do the exam review materials and make use of your TF's office hours for help on the more advanced concepts in the Psets and on the exam review materials.,"Taking this course has proved to be the best decision I've made this year.  Basic economic knowledge is essential to understanding how society works and how to make society better.  I had no experience in economics before this class, but now Economics is my number one concentration option.","Very good class. You learn a lot about economics, but also about government and public policy.",Unless you are taking this class to fulfill a concentration requirement I would avoid it. It is a solid introduction into the material but i would not describe it as the most fulfilling class.,Take this course to have a better understanding of the world and why it works the way that it does.,Very important for understanding the dynamics of human exchange,"Iconic class, why not take it?  Basic economic principles useful in everyday life.",It's fun and useful!!!,"It's a pretty good class. Not fantastic. It's very dumbed down, but that's necessary for an introductory course. Get started on your psets early in the week (i.e. not before Thursday night) or else you'll drown.","I would say that learning how to think in terms of economics is useful, but that the course itself is flawed.","This is a good class to take for anyone who is interested in Economics, but most of the lectures and the sections don't provide any additional information on what can be found in Mankiw book.","This is a very good introductory course to economics.  Lectures are generally unhelpful, but David Johnson is amazing.","The material is pretty boring, but you'll feel better about your understanding of the world when it's all over. Don't bother with the textbook, just pay attention in section, go to the course-wide reviews, and watch the occasional YouTube clip if you don't get it. Work with a partner.","Well it is the only option, so you have to take it. I would tell people to definitely keep up with their work and make sure that they understand key concepts soon after they are introduced, as if you wait too long you will have much more trouble. Definitely keep up with the readings.","Read for understanding not memorization! Synthesis synthesis synthesis. All of the concepts build upon each other so if you skip the first few chapters because you think they're simple you will have a  rocky foundation. Go to officer hours for help not answers, you should have at least tried something on your own. Do all the practice tests.",The class can be extremely rewarding and interesting or not depending on your effort.,"I enjoyed it, and it will definitely tell you if economics is the field for you.",make sure to understand the material and not put it off for a later date,"Not a class you can just blow off, particularly if you have never had previous experience with ec before. Not an easy gened!",Switch out of a section with a bad TF,"Excellent course overall.  One will feel incredibly accomplished at the end of the semester for ones increased problem solving capabilities and more flexible way of thinking.  Information is applicable to everyday life, so the course is great for people intending to concentrate in the subject or just taking it out of personal interest.",Be prepared to be challenged and have your eyes opened to this world. Very interesting and mind blowing stuff.,"Highly dependent on TF quality (I was lucky, but from what I've heard from others).",Best advice I can give is to make sure you are happy with your TF. Having a bad TF will ruin the learning experience for you.,This course is wonderful as long as you have a TF who is enthusiastic and knowledgable about the course material.,"You're probably going to have to take this class to fulfill a requirement. It's tough that the course depends so heavily on the quality of your TF, but you'll at least learn something from it by the end. Not sure how it'll go without David Johnson though.","This class might not be the most exciting course at Harvard, but it does build a strong foundation of basic economics knowledge. I feel that I am prepared to pursue future studies in the subject.",This is an awesome course!  The material is very interesting and the teachers are great.  It really opens your eyes to how the world works around you and how people make decisions.  No previous economics background is necessary to take the course.,"This course has problem sets that will take you a long time, exams that are tricky and really require you to think deeply and critically about applying concepts, and lectures that are often boring and/or biased and/or irrelevant to the rest of the course. However, it does teach you a lot about economic principles and gives a solid basis for understanding some policies and markets. David Johnson is an awesome teacher and you should go to his office hours and review sessions to clarify topics, especially if your section leader is not on point (and many are not).","Although this class sometimes gets a bad name, I found it to be one of the most enlightening experiences I have had during my three years at Harvard so far.",The experience you have depends greatly on your TF. It is a great way to learn the basics.,Don't take this class because everyone else is taking it.,"As someone who had never before taken an economics class, I found this course to be a very enjoyable introduction to the subject. The material was the right balance of challenging and manageable, which I appreciated.",Try to take Ec 1010 if you have any prior Ec experience at all.,"The psets are challenging and quite often only distantly related to section and lecture. However, they provide you the opportunity to creatively apply what you've learned and to view the material in new lights. This is a great course if you have any interest in the field at all.",It is a useful course and a smart choice to take it.,It's necessary.,"Definitely worth taking, especially if you've never studied economics before. It'll change the way you look at a lot of institutions and processes and that's pretty cool. The TFs are generally pretty strong (mine was great) and the exams and material hard but rewarding if you put in solid work. I think having a ec background is super important, so it was totally worth it to me. Just be aware: Mankiw is not super helpful, nor a very good lecturer, and he does have a political bias - it's not too bade but it helps to take his lectures with a bit of a grain of salt.","I think you should only take this if you're considering being an economics concentrator. I think there are much better classes if you'd like to fulfill the General Education Requirement. Also, you might want to do the readings as I think this class will be a lot worse without David Johnson, he's a bro.","I think it is extremely important to learn the material covered in this class, as it genuinely explained a lot of things about how the world works to me in areas that I didn't even realise I had a deficiency in my understanding in, but I felt that it was a poorly designed course, which made covering the material much more painful to go through than it should have. Also, the fact that the people who do best in this course are those who have already taken some Economics, or spend a lot of extra time on their own on the material, would suggest that the course is not effective. I would therefore consider Ec10 a necessary evil.",It's not very engaging unless you are a concentrator or into economics,ec10a was a good class. Decently well run. I believe it depends on who the TF you get is.,Attend all of David Johnson's office hours.,Everyone should take introductory economics. It is fundamental to understanding the modern world in which we live.,"Your experience really depends on the section leader you get. Even the curves depend on your exam/ section group, so there's nothing much you can do.","Make use of the optional unit exams, they help a lot in solidifying your understanding of the material",Reasonably interesting!,it't not too hard but going to section is annoying,"Valuable if interested in economics, but a significant time/effort commitment, and not many lectures.",Very bread-and-butter intro economics class. Makes you feel like you're in a large public school with huge lecturers and half the school taking the course. But you learn what's necessary.,"Start the P.sets as soon as you get the chance, go to lectures and section, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, read the book, and you should be just fine.","This class is really hard. Unless you are very serious about economics or have taken the course before, I wouldn't recommend it.","Very difficult class but definitely worth it.  You learn a lot about how the world works.  A lot of important info that you will carry with you.  Even if you are not considering concentrating or getting a secondary in economics, everyone should take this class.  Psets and exams are really difficult but the curve is generous.",David Johnson is the strength of this class. He is literally amazing. He has so many office hours and makes himself available for the students. His explanations and enthusiasm for the subject matter is really inspiring and comprehensive. What I got out of this class came out from the few times I went to his review sessions or office hours.That being said...very few people are lucky enough to get into David Johnson's section. How your semester goes really will be based on whom you get as a TF. Anyone can do well in the class by getting extra help but how much extra work you put in will depend on your TF.,"I took this class as a junior which was both a great and terrible decision. It was great because I know more about what I want to get out of my time at Harvard, so I was less stressed about each problem set and could see the big picture without focusing on each week's assignments and readings. It was terrible because I wish I had taken it earlier. I declared a different concentration, and at this point, I do not have enough time to switch my concentration. Had I taken it freshman or sophomore year, I would have declared Economics. I recommend taking it sophomore year. It is a stressful class to take as a freshman, but don't take it too late. It's incredible, and taking Ec10 was one of the best decisions I've made at Harvard.","You learn valuable information in this course, but the exams are very difficult.","Just keep up with the readings and go to section.  Section teaches you a majority of the information so don't skip out on it.  Also, make sure to go to office hours. They are a lifesaver for the psets as well as the exams.",Course structure needs work but course content is good.,"If you are interested in the material, it is a great course to take. It will also be useful in the future, so it's never a bad decision. However if you know you don't want to concentrate in economics, it might not be the best choice.","Ec10a with Greg Mankiw is a good intro to the field of Economics. It gives a solid foundation for those wishing to concentrate in the subject, and it gives a good taste to those simply wishing to know a little about Economics. Ec10a does an excellent job of teaching students to ""think at the margin"" and view their actions and decisions from an economic perspective.","I would highly recommend this course to all students. This course significantly raised my understanding of the world around me and gave me specific tools for analysis. I now have better knowledge to tackle the news and current events with and have applied the fundamentals of economics in all of my other classes this semester across various disciplines. Although this class is not extremely difficult, it does require lots of time, thought, and energy. Problem sets and unit tests are key for comprehension and thus need to be taken seriously.","A must-take if you haven't already taken AP Microeconomics in high school. As cliche as it sounds, it's true- economics is such a powerful factor that shapes our day-to-day lives, so understanding it is key to becoming a more informed individual and citizen. The workload is relatively light (consisting only of 6 required problem sets and 3 exams for the whole semester) and if you have good quantitative reasoning skills then this class should be enjoyable and relatively straightforward. That being said, your experience in Ec 10 largely depends on your section leader since the vast majority of the course is taught in section, and I have heard that there is a wide variety in quality among the different section leaders. However, mine was excellent and so I found the course to be very enjoyable. Also- take the unit tests!!!","As a class that is stereotypically full of freshman, it can still be pretty tough. If you have any interest in economics, it's definitely worth taking though. Make sure to find a section leader you like though, because the majority of the class is taught in section. Only a handful of lectures, but don't make the mistake of not going to any of them, because a lot more lecture questions appear on exams than you'd think.",Do the problem sets by yourself and make sure you fully understand what you are doing.,"Difficult, but necessary for greater understanding of society. Even if this is not a concentration requirement, it is very applicable to many different fields.","Ec10a was better than I expected it, and better than its reputation. The material is pretty important for everyone in general to understand. You should understand it is a section-based course, and it would be a mistake to expect a lecture course by Mankiw (who lectured about 6 times). Because of this, it might feel more like a high school course. Beware of your section leader's shortcomings.",Great preparation for life in general. Economics makes just reading articles (the paper is for chumps) much more enjoyable,Move out of your section as soon as possible if you have a very poor teaching fellow.,"This class is not going to be easy! Be prepared to spend lots of time outside class studying, processing, practicing, and trying to understand the material -- problem sets are notoriously stymieing. Lectures are few and far between and sections are very much a gamble. Overall the material is informative and useful, but the concepts and class structure are tough.",The textbook is not enough,"Unless you have taken economics before (and maybe even if you have), this class is hard work, but there are many resources in place to help you out. Just make sure that you can set aside the time to take advantage of them all: TF's office hours, Unit Tests, optional psets, etc. All worth doing.","Take the unit tests, keep up with the readings, and go to David Johnson's office hours when you have questions. If you can stay on top of the material, the class is really straightforward, simple, and a nice way of knocking out the Empirical Reasoning GenEd. Also look at the past exams and problems sets, because the majority of exam questions are directly ripped from/slightly modified versions of questions from previous tests and homework.","It is necessary in order to pursue a concentration in Economics, but even if you're not, the knowledge it gives you is very useful and applicable to every day life.","If you want to be an economics major, you have to take it. That said, EC 10 is fairly difficult and if you don't keep up, it can quickly become overwhelming. Do your homework, go to section, GO TO LECTURES, and take notes.",The class is easy but you have to teach yourself the material and go to David Johnson's office hours because the section TFs aren't very good.,"Ec 10 is a classic huge course. The material is basic, with limited engagement from faculty and a disconnected feel. Your satisfaction in this course is entirely dependent upon who your section leader is and whether or not you're actually interested in any of the material being covered. Even if you feel like you have a great grasp of the material and kill it on the problem sets, you may be set up for disappointment on the exams. Standards are vague and inconsistent.","Okay, so, you're not taking this class because you particularly want to take Ec 10. You take it because you have to - either to be an Ec concentrator or because your other social science requires it, or because your academic advisor is somewhat dull in the head. Either way, it's not going to be a particularly pleasant experience. Work in section is straightforward-enough, problem sets are somewhat challenging, but perfectly fine if you go to office hours. Exams are tricky, to make a distinction in ability among the giant class. Make sure to study. Take it if you must, but certainly place out if you have AP scores.","Make sure you take advantage of office hours and extra help sessions, even if they happen to be with various TFs","Much of Ec10's successes or failures come from the ability of your TF.  I was fortunate enough to have a spectacular TF, which means I had a spectacular experience.  At the same time, however, some of my roommates had TFs that were not as great, and they did not have as great an experience as I did.  If all TFs were at the same level, I would have no issue recommending with enthusiasm.  The course is a great introduction to economics for those without a prior background, and I had a great time learning about it.","You should take this course. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's impersonal. But you do learn, and you learn a lot. Not just economics, but how to think. Everyone should HAVE to take this course.","This course gives a good foundation of economics but sometimes the topics and important concepts get lost along the way. Although not necessary, having some sort of an economics background is extremely helpful. Even just studying some things on your own beforehand might make this course a little easier.","If you take one class at Harvard, this should be it. A basic understanding of economics is the obligation of every participating citizen in this country.","It's a decent amount of work but is not that difficult. The class often seems tedious, but is nonetheless fairly useful.",read the textbook,The class is certainly useful for understanding basic economic principles that will be useful for all students regardless of their future occupations.,"If you have taken economics before go for it! If not, take this with friends",Enjoy it. It's awesome.,"I actually don't mind it, but I feel like that is because of my TF more than anything. It is an okay course.",Tough class but if you apply yourself it's very rewarding.,It's a good way to learn Microeconomics,It is a very thought provoking class that let's you view the world in a much more analytical way. It forces you to think outside the box and this concept is very enjoyable for many students as myself. Problem sets are engaging and relevant. The only complaint I have is how impersonal Mankiw is with the class. He rarely lectures and barely teaches anything. Everything is done by our TFs. David Johnson (Head TF) is a boss but he's leaving so econ will be slightly different next year.,"This course teaches a lot of material in a way that enables students to synthesize it all (or at least most of it).  David Johnson is a fantastic course head who is willing to go above and beyond to help students understand topics in his office hours and review sessions.  He is truly an amazing teacher and cares about students rather than research (and it is too bad he is leaving).  The fact that there were some very impressive guest lecturers in addition to the regular sections was useful in terms of understanding the topics in the book through section and then hearing about applications of these ideas in lecture.  The problem sets could also be done in groups, which is great if you have a lot of other work to do and can split the work up with a friend or two in section and then go over it together.  I feel that I now have a much better understanding of microeconomics.",You learn a lot about economics from the course.,It will open your mind to previously unthought of possibilities,Go to office hours!!!!!,Ec10: A giant conspiracy formulated by Greg Mankiw to get a bunch of saps to buy his $200 textbook,Take this course if you have to; avoid it if you don't.,"Unless you get a good TF, it is very hard to learn effectively in this class. Most learning I did was on my own outside of the section.","The class is necessary for the Ec concentration, but by no means expect a fun or entertaining class. It's basic Ec, and nothing more.",It is an interesting class that made me consider switching my concentration to economics.,It's not that interesting a topic in general but it does provide the necessary background to go on in economics i think.,Good stuff to know but not taught very well,The course is difficult but manageable,"This class isn't that hard if you take the time to learn the materials, but this is especially important if you don't have a good TF.","it is not the most fun course, but you do learn a lot.",It is a great class and in order to do well it is important to stay up to date on the readings,"It's a pretty interesting class. If you are interested in concentrating in economics, you'll have to take it anyway.","It won't blow your mind or change the way you think (at least it didn't for me), but you'll learn about economic modeling and microeconomic theory.",They try their best to make introductory economics not mundane.,work HARD. put in a lot of time.,This course is not a great course because essentially all the material is taught in section by graduate students so your experience really depends on your section tf. The lectures are an interesting supplement to section as you apply the material to the actual world. Take this course because you have no choice if you want to move up to higher level economics courses taught by actual professors.,I wouldn't take this class unless you really really liked economics or it's a requirement.,"This class is the foundation of economics, which is the foundation of the world's functionality.",Take this class. It's interesting and provides the important base you need for further study in economics.,Difficult but worth it.,I would tell them that this course to take to be a well informed citizen and not be ignorant of important issues that are heavily related to the field of economics.,"If you are interested in working on Wall Street, this class is largely irrelevant to such a profession.  In fact, the field of Economics seems to only have relevance in the public sector and consists of mostly abstract concepts.  So, if you have taken Ec prior and disliked it, I can't say that this class will be enjoyable for you.  Don't just take this course because you think it will signal a future interest in working in finance, take it if you are genuinely interested in the subject.",Understand that you won't get taught by actual professors most of the time,N/A,go to office hours,Be wary of the workload,"Exams hard, material interesting if you like math",I never thought that I would enjoy an economics class but Ec10 is very engaging and applicable to real world problems. It gives you a good foundation for evaluating economic policy. The problem sets are challenging but very effective in making sure you can apply the concepts. The tests are fair evaluations of what you learn. David Johnson is super enthusiastic and engaging.
Economics,ECON 970: Tutorial - Sophomore Year,You learn a lot about how to think about economics and write well in the field.,"Take Ovul Sezer's course. She is an EXCELLENT instructor, a fair grader, super passionate about the class material, and very accessible & responsive to emails.",It is requires a lot of reading but the material is very interesting and the assignments are not to difficult.,"Not the most exciting course, but you'll learn a lot and its required.","Kiran is a remarkably engaging and passionate lecturer who is so wonderfully dedicated to the field of developmental economics. Just a note: this is an incredibly labor intensive course with difficult material and more assignments than comparable tutorials. Highly recommend taking this course after econometrics not concurrently, and only if you have a serious passion in going into the developmental economic field.","JANE IS A GEM!!! Oh My Gosh!! I can't even begin to describe how great and down to earth she is! She is so willing to help you if you struggle a bit ( and I struggled through it sometimes), but she is so understanding. But of course, you have to be willing to reach out to her. I'm glad I did :) :) :) Jane is the best part of this class. Also, her own research is extremely interesting!",I really liked it. I think there's a lot of readings but Kiran is amazingly nice and patient.,"Learn from Dorian, he has been my favorite TF i have had at Harvard","It was a totally different take on economics, but I really enjoyed the subject.",The class has a nice balance between social psychology and economics,"Dorian is the best instructor I've had at Harvard and nobody even comes close. His ultimate goal is to have every student come away with a better understanding of what really happened during the financial crisis, and along the way, you really learn how to write and think like an economist. He's incredible and I'd encourage everybody to sign up for his tutorial.","Dorian is an awesome teacher. Although a bit boring at times, he generates enthusiasm for the topic and really cares about his students and teaching. The class is probably a bit easier than a lot of the other tutorials, but also equally (if not more) interesting."
Economics,ECON 980aa: The Rise of  Asia and the World Economy,"Professor Jorgenson is very knowledgeable and I really enjoyed attending his lectures and the students' presentations. Having some prior knowledge regarding Asian economies is not a prerequisite, however, it is recommendable. Find the datasets you need for your paper early (!) in the semester, it will save you a lot of stress at the end. Do attend Professor Jorgenson's and Wentao's office hours regularly, it will help a lot!","I loved the course! Definitely got to apply a lot of the skills that I learned in earlier classes to the research paper in this class, which was really valuable since I was able to learn a lot during the process.","This is a fun class with a relatively light workload but quite interesting subject matter. You'll get to learn about the latest Asian economic developments and discuss them in a fairly congenial setting. The paper is also a good opportunity to flex your research muscles, though think very carefully about data sources before you choose your topic.  Professor Jorgenson is one of the nicest professors in the Ec Department--go to his office hours!","I recommend this course very much. The insights that Professor Jorgenson offers in class about the economic issues in China, India, and Japan are very interesting and relevant to the current state of the world economy. Final paper and student presentation are also two large parts of this course, and if you seek guidance during the course of the semester, the experience will become even more rewarding.","This a great course to learn about the growth of Asian economies, and learn how to conduct focused independent research.",This class can be chill with little time commitment if you want it to be. But both Professor Jorgenson and the TFs are wonderful resources and you can get so much out of the course beyond the lectures if you put in extra time and effort.,"If you are interested in Asian Economy, I'd highly recommend this course. Professor Jorgensen is a really great professor. He gives a lot of valuable feedback and tries his best to get to know every of his students. You will have to write a 25 page paper about a economic topic of choice and it helps a lot if you are already comfortable with STATA, but if you struggle with something you have some great resources available. This was for sure one of my favorite classes I had so far.","The class itself covers very interesting topics.  You will leave this class with a solid understanding of Asian markets and the global economy.  It is not overly difficult every week as the only graded assignments are a presentation and a final paper, but those two assignments are difficult.  There is a lot of support from the teaching staff, and you will be prepared for the final paper.  If you are thinking of writing a thesis, this class will be helpful.  Professor Jorgenson does a great job of meeting with students and even takes us out to dinner.  The class itself is tough, but you will learn a lot about the topics.",Jorgenson is great! You get to dine with him and his wife for class dinner. You get a lot of 1 on 1 time with the Professor.
Economics,ECON 980u: Immigration Economics,"This had been my favorite class at Harvard. You learn from an amazing professor that is very knowledgeable about the subject. If you are interested in labor economics or immigration economics, I would really recommend this class,","This class is a great opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic with an academic who is right at the top of his field. Take it! Some of what you'll learn is intellectually depressing: it's very hard to come up with robust answers to knotty empirical questions, and sensible people can come to very different conclusions. With controversial topics like immigration, this effect is magnified. But overall a very fun course. Borjas is cool!","Prof. Borjas is an expert in this field. If you have ever been curious about why people move, who moves, and the impact of movers then take this class! Prof Borjas cares about the students and is very available outside of class. Take his seminar!","Professor Borjas is an incredibly caring professor, get to know him and you will gain so much more from the course! He is truly the expert on this... I mean, he's written the textbook..."
Economics,ECON 980x: Economics of Work and Family,"This course is fantastic.  The subject is amazing and engaging and Claudia is the expert in the field.  Since the class is small, you get to know Claudia, Andy and the class, which doesn't happen often in econ.  This was by far my favorite class this semester.  Claudia is brilliant and quirky.  The class really gets you to think differently about economics and how to write an econ paper.  I highly recommend taking it if you are at all interested.","Take this class if you are trying to decide whether to write a senior thesis. The course is structured to guide you through the research process in a very manageable way. Professor Goldin and our TF Andy Garin were extremely patient, encouraging, and generous with their time.",This is really a wonderful course. Professor Goldin is an outstanding professor and willing to go our of her way to help students succeed. The weekly time commitment is minimal although if you don't do the required reading you will not get nearly as much out of it. The final paper was difficult but extremely rewarding.,It's a privilege to receive guidance on a research paper from one of the nation's most prominent economists. Take this class!,"Interesting topic, low workload but a lot is expected of you - be prepared, Claudia will challenge you!","The material is very interesting and extremely relevant, and the teaching staff can't be beat. Do start the paper early, though, because it's not fun to have a research paper of that size creep up on you. Other than that, this class really pushes you to think about how economic theory can be applied to real life, and is well worth taking."
Economics,"ECON 985k: Research in Macroeconomics, Finance, and Modeling","If you are an economics or applied math economics student interesting in thesis writing, this class is a must-take. coming into the semester, I underestimated how much time it takes to do research. this class has helped guide me by making sure I'm making progress every week and helping me set periodic deadlines for myself, which is what you need. also having yao as an instructor has been extremely helpful. he's super quick getting back to you with advice, so if you're interested in financial economics, try to get into his section!","It is time consuming, especially the STATA tutorial if you haven't done it already. It is best to go hard organizationally early on so later in the semester you aren't crunched for time.",Take advantage of this course as much as possible! Your section leader is there to help you.,Writing a thesis will rank among the most engaging intellectual experiences at Harvard.,"The thesis seminar is required if you want to write an Ec thesis. However, I can only speak for Yao, who was not the most organised or most helpful section leader."
Economics,ECON 985l: Research in Development and Health Economics,Go with a concentration advisor when you're choosing a 985 seminar,Writing a thesis is going to be one of the most rewarded things you have ever done academically.,You should really be dedicated to your topic- don't just do it to do it or you will regret it.,Make sure to plan your thesis work well ahead of time!,"Kiran's thesis seminar on Development and Health Economics is an absolutely wonderful seminar! If you're thinking about writing a thesis, I highly encourage taking Kiran's class. She gives such individualized feedback, making time during her busy schedule to read your drafts entirely and provide huge amounts of helpful advice. You meet with her every week, and throughout the semester you also hear about other peers' theses in small discussion seminars. Kiran is also extremely knowledgeable about topics in development economics and can give helpful direction when it comes to econometric issues. She is extremely friendly and approachable! Moreover, the seminar meetings are extremely participatory and conversation-based, which fosters an environment of ""learning from each other"" in class. Finally, the STATA mini-course provides very helpful foundations for your thesis, though I wish a little bit more guidance and direction were given (particularly when it came to STATA codes)."
Economics,"ECON 985m: Research in International Trade, Education, and Public Economics",Thesis writing is hard but rewarding!,"The senior thesis seminar provides a nice opportunity to present your thesis as it evolves throughout the semester, and receive feedback from classmates and an adviser. There are regular assignments throughout the semester such as a justification, data paper, and literature review. The semester concludes with a 25-page draft of your thesis-in-progress. Classes meet about half of the weeks throughout the semester, and individual meetings with the adviser take place on the other weeks. It's not too stressful in and of itself, though the thesis can be stressful, of course. Anne Le Brun is a fantastic teacher/adviser. I'd highly recommend her if you have the opportunity.",Anne is a great seminar leader and really does try her best to help you with your thesis topic! She's always willing to sit down and chat about your topic and provides very personalized feedback where you in the writing process. It's also nice to get feedback from other students in a group setting as they can also have useful input about your project. Highly recommend preferencing Anne if you're thinking about taking the seminar.,Don't be a poltroon. Write a thesis.,"Anne was very helpful and it was great having someone else to bounce ideas off of.  Additionally, having deadlines was helpful to keep you on track. However, the psets and deadlines often seemed like a waste of time as they weren't tailored to where you currently were in you thesis.",Anne is a fantastic seminar leader! She is very hands-on and accessible and puts a lot of thought into improving the quality of your work.
Economics,"ECON 985n: Research in Applied Microeconomics, Labor and Gender","If you are writing a thesis, you have to take this class. I overall enjoyed it. Jane is a great tutorial leader and I know the other instructors are awesome! The feedback was helpful and the assignments helped you stay on track. The stata psets were annoying because they took hours. I would work on that more than my thesis on a given week."
Economics,"ECON 985p: Research in Finance, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics","If you want to write a thesis, take this course!",Make sure you have an idea of what you would like to write about and make sure you're really excited about your thesis topic.,"I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The Stata problem sets are horrible and you might as well just go to office hours rather than spend lots of hours spinning your wheels. Eventually you will come to appreciate stata but only after working through it yourself on your own thesis towards a goal. Also, definitely try to have a topic ready before the semester begins, it would make the process a lot easier."

This is one of the only times at Harvard where you will be able to do just as you please-- and the possibilities for that are many! Writing a thesis will get you in touch with a wonderful professor and also acquaint you to how your peers are doing. Extremely important exercise at Harvard.,"The first thing you must consider when enrolling is the time commitment of a thesis. Rebecca is excellent for thesis writers and people serious about a single semester research paper. However, if you do not have a passion for what you are researching AND an advisor that supports you and pushes you at times, this course can get annoying or difficult.","Rebecca is really helpful and invested in your thesis work. This pushes you to stay on a strict timeline where you are making clear progress throughout the semester, which culminates in a 25-page paper at the end of the semester.",This class is a fantastic thesis tutorial. I have been continually impressed with how relevant the work in this class has been for helping me to progress with my thesis and the support offered by Rebecca is incredible. I would highly recommend this class for Ec and AM/Ec thesis writers- it will make the process so much more structured and painless.,"Mandatory for Economics thesis writers, this course forces you to progress in your thesis research.",Fantastic way to write a thesis - the deadlines and support are invaluable.
Economics,ECON 1010a: Microeconomic Theory,Basically self-study,Only take this is if you're thinking about concentrating in Economics. It's wildly boring and doesn't connect with relevant and interesting themes in Economics.,"This class is awful, but you gotta do it for ec.",Take this course only if you absolutely need to.,"Do the psets even if they aren't graded! If you can teach yourself well, read the textbook rather than attend lecture. This class is a stepping stone to many topics beyond - and intermediate economics will be dry before the fun stuff that follows!","If you have a choice of getting dipped in caustic acid or taking this course, I implore you to choose the former. It is by far the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Miron clearly hates teaching it, and if the leader of the class hates it, then clearly the students will hate it as well. Don't think I'm alone in this opinion. I haven't heard a single good thing about this class from anyone. It needs serious revamping. I absolutely abhorred this class.","This isn't a good class, which is really disappointing because microeconomics can actually be really interesting. Lecture is dull and confusing and section is completely useless (if you even go), so you end up having to teach yourself all the material. The exams look nearly identical to the optional problem sets, so do the problem sets. Miron gets really excited when he talks about drug legalization, but otherwise lecture is monotonous. This class is also more like a math course than like an economics course: you don't learn any theory beyond what was already covered in Ec10a, but you do learn the math behind these models.","This class is not engaging on any level.  The lectures and sections were not helpful at all, and the readings were often confusing and more complicated than the exam material.","Only take this course if you are an Economics concentrator. This course is terribly structured, the curve on exams is terrible, and Miron doesn't seem to care about what he is teaching. I don't think I actually learned anything in this course.","You should take this class over Ec10 if you have any economics knowledge. I'm talking bare minimum. You'll learn the material if you go to section. Lecture? Now that's a different story. Lecture has nothing, and I mean nothing, to do with the PSET. It DOES help you see the practical application of microeconomics, but attending lecture won't give you an A. That being said, go to at least one. Miron is a interesting guy, so it's not like you'll be bored. Regarding section, GO TO IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. It is immensely key to your success. By success, I don't mean getting an A; you'll get that if you go, but you'll actually enjoy the learning process if you learn the material from a TA.",It's not great but it isn't horrible. It's not a huge workload and very doable. It also enables you to take a lot of cool higher level ec classes. So if it's a requirement definitely take it and don't worry too much.,"Take the class if it's a requirement.  The minimal amount of work makes it fairly painless, especially as lectures/sections/psets/everything is optional.  But don't expect to get anything out of it whatsoever.",Please do not waste your time with this class. You will not learn anything.,"Really terrible class. Don't expect to learn much. That said, you can put in a very low amount of work and do fine. If you have to take it, you will survive.","The median grade for our exams were crazy high. We had an exam where you couldn't miss a question to make an A (re: perfect score). Also, the problem sets were optional, yet anywhere between 3-6 problem set questions were on every midterm...verbatim. This class is weird.",Just take the class. Not the best but useful and Miron is engaging and interesting.,This class deserves its reputation.  For many ec or applied math concentrators it is a required class and much more manageable than the alternative ec 1011.  However be prepared to be terribly bored and feel that the material and skills you are tested on are very disconnected from what is covered in lecture and the textbook.  Great sophomore fall class as it is possible to get by cramming for the midterms and putting very little effort into the class otherwise.  This class is not a gem by any means but in terms of workload is the best bad option.,The reason I've passed this class is from Ec10a and Math 1a last year. I did not learn new material this semester and had to figure out how to apply the concepts on my own.,"The material is interesting, but the presentation isn't the best. Take the class nonetheless because the material is useful and powerful.",The tests for this class are directly off the p-sets.,"take it for the concentration. the class is very sink or swim, and if you don't have the head TF and are passive about getting help, you can be at a strong disadvantage. lectures are not critical and often just going through confusing derivations of equations (which you will never be tested on) with weird notations, so don't be stressed out if you didn't understand lecture. the course's tf staff needs to improve a lot as well. students often complain about section leaders not knowing how to do problems efficiently, digressing, etc. the exams and psets were relatively easy, almost deceptively though because the final turned out to be extremely difficult and tricky","Unless required, probably want to skip this one.","It is a class you have to take, so you have to take it.","This course was altogether very unfulfilling. The entire grade on the course was based on five multiple-choice exams. The first four midterms were 15 questions each, and the final had around 30 questions. This makes up your entire grade for the courses--which many students felt was a very poor assessment of their microeconomic knowledge. None of the problem sets are graded, because they were all multiple choice! There was no incentive to stay up-to-date with the course, and it felt like the teaching staff as very uninvested in the success of the students. Miron begins the course by saying that the class will be boring--well of course the class will be boring if it's the mindset going in. The textbook was actually quite interesting--it's entirely possible to make this class engaging. 1010a was not. If you can stomach the math, 1011a is recommended. 10a taught me so much more econ than this class did.",The material is interesting but can get pretty dry. Exams are tricky because they are all multiple choice.,"Stay on top of everything.  It is easy to neglect doing ec homework because the psets are easy, but do it for the tests.  Also, it is important to understand the math as you go along.  The math builds, so it is important to know how everything relates.","If this were an elective, I would not recommend it to anyone who is not genuinely interested in economics because it is very dry.","It's not a lot of work, but you still have to study for tests because the curve was pretty harsh given the MC format of all of the assessments.","This class felt like an independent study. The problem sets were not too difficult and the structure allowed you to do the work when you deemed necessary. The freedom and hands off nature of this course however came at the cost of many being disengaged. I learned more about study habits from this test then the actual material. Solving these problems can actually be very fun, but from the first day the class was portrayed as being boring and taxing which had a negative effect on people's attitude about the course going into it.","This semester there were 4 midterms (with 15/16 multiple choice questions on each midterm) and a final of 34 multiple choice questions. The midterms aren't too bad, make sure you go to section since they actually cover the test material, but the final was BRUTAL since it's a lot of material and there were several questions that were foreign to me. Make the final a priority!!! Pretty sure it's going to kick my grade in the butt :(","This class is a lot of self-learning, and Miron definitely does not want to be teaching. If you are to take this class, make sure to go to a TF's section that actually understands the material and is willing to explain the problem sets to you.","Midterms were extremely easy if you look at the problem sets, but the final was extremely hard. You don't have to go to lecture, so I'd suggest doing the readings and going to section. Your whole grade is based on 96 multiple choice questions...",Consider knowing Ec10 very well before taking this class,"This is a requirement for Econ concentrators. You have to take it. It's not interesting material, but it is necessary.","The course is good if you want a better foundation in the principles of economics and want to learn how to apply univariate calculus to economic problems. The midterms are fairly straightforward, so much so that it is not uncommon for students to score perfect scores on them. This means you really have to be on top of the problem set questions and concepts, which the midterms are based off, in order to get a good grade. The final was terribly unfair and did not accurately represent what we had covered in class or in the problem sets. Make sure you really understand the concepts and the mathematical relationships of economic principles if you want to do well on the final. Overall, the class is good to better your economic foundation, but you're really going to have to strive for perfection (literally) in order to get an A.",Lectures are not taught great but this class is necessary for economics concentrators. Section is definitely worth going to and problem sets are a must.,"Unless this class changes, it is one of the worst classes you can take at Harvard.",Fun,"Unfortunately, for Ec concentrators, this class is a requirement.  The one thing I will say is that this course prepares you to think like an economist and forces you to use intuition because there is nothing (like, absolutely nothing, between abstruse textbooks and poorly-run lectures) that will support you through this. That said, the material isn't too difficult at all, and the gems of economic theory that you can scrape from the answers of the p-sets make the course bearable, at least somewhat.","The only reason you should ever take this class if you're an Econ concentrator and absolutely have to. Lectures are extremely disengaging: not a single person pays attention, and by the end of September, not a single person even attends lecture, because they are extremely irrelevant and scattered. The course does not measure how much Econ you'll learn throughout the semester (which is unfortunately not much at all), but rather how good you are at memorizing problem set questions and trying to solve abstract and unfair test questions that do not measure how much you actually studied or how much you know. Overall, a very disengaging course that you should only suffer through if you're concentrating in Economics; otherwise -- I never thought I'd say this -- you're better off learning basic Econ in Ec10.","Take it because it is a necessity, but don't expect to do the bare minimum and learn.","It is not a lot of work, but you will also walk out not feeling like you learned anything new, apart from memorizing multiple choice questions and applying them on the exams.",You really do not learn much from this class since the exams are just based on the psets. I wish the exams were harder and really tested your knowledge of econ rather than how well you simply memorize practice questions.,"The material for 1010a is interesting. Prof. Miron is pretty cool if you put effort into getting to know him outside of class. That said, you will have to find a way to keep yourself awake in lectures, and think consciously about how to get more out of the class than just equations that you need for the p-sets (which you will probably forget after the final anyway.","This course is unfortunate, but it could be much worse.  Professor Miron was a very, very bad lecturer, but if you go to section and do the readings, you might actually find the material covered in this course to be relevant to other aspects of your life.  The 4 exam + 1 final format, without mandatory problem sets, was a bit bizarre, but it did help in that you could do very poorly on one exam without destroying your grade.  Also, there was nothing subjective about the grading system.  The assessments aren't very difficult, but the lack of weekly structure made this course demand a lot of individual effort compared to the multitude of assessments with Ec10.  Especially if you like microeconomics better than macro, go ahead and take this for your secondary, but don't expect to become much better versed in microeconomics theory than after Ec 10.  This essentially just added more math, which you don't generally need in daily life.","This course was the worst of my four this semester. The professor makes lecture so boring and disengaging that 60-70% of the class stopped showing up to lecture by the second week. Lecture topics are completely unrelated to the problem sets, which you MUST study for the four midterms. Make sure you get Nancy as your TF, because she is the only one who knows exactly what she is talking about. You need to get Nancy!",I would tell students to prepare for very dry and un - stimulating lectures and a maths - centered economics class.,"I have such mixed feelings about this class. I found the content difficult, the professor boring and uninterested, and the lectures convoluted and useless. I loved that problem sets were not graded because it allowed me to spend time on the class when I had time and ignore it when I did not. And for all of its faults, it could not have a better group of tfs. Eli and Nancy are wonderful teaching fellows, extremely dedicated to their students and willing to go above and beyond in order to help everyone achieve success.","It's terribly taught and structured, but it's not hard. Memorize the steps for answering all the pset questions and you're set. Lecture is incredibly boring but unfortunately not taped","There are some courses here at Harvard that are absolutely fascinating and expand your understanding and interpretation of the world. This is not one of those courses.

This is not necessarily the fault of Professor Miron or the teaching staff. Though lectures could sometimes be uninteresting and go at too fast a pace, the teaching staff were nice and helpful. Rather, the problem lies in the material itself: conceptually, you learn the exact same things as in Ec10a and don't really go more in-depth with the concepts. The only thing that's different is that there's more math. Because of this fact, it's almost impossible for this course to actually be interesting. 

This isn't really a painful course in the sense that the material isn't too difficult and the exams, though too numerous (there's four midterms!) are largely fair. If you have to take this for the Ec concentration, don't worry too much; it's not a massive time commitment. If you don't have to take it, though, I probably wouldn't.","Don't let this course dissuade you of doing the Econ track! I know it's dry, I know you will not like the lectures, but the electives after this course should be really interesting!","Lecture is disorganized and hard to follow, but the midterms are fairly straightforward.",do the pests,"Try and think about the material and invest, you get out of it what you put in. The course is better for someone with a mathematical tendency","I would tell other students that the course moves really fast, especially at the beginning even during shopping week, so it is important not to fall behind.",This course design is pretty unstructured so students considering to take this course will have to be prepared to do a substantial amount of self-studying for the class.,If your Econ and don't want to do 1011a you have to take it. Miron hates teaching it and nobody puts in any work but the material can be interesting.,This was probably the worst course I have taken. Professor Miron makes it clear from the first lecture that he is less interested in being there than the students. The exams test whether students make stupid errors rather than whether they understand the underlying economic concepts.,"This class is horrible. Take it only if you need it for a requirement. Really, don't take it.",Professor Miron and the TFs are very knowledgeable so seek them out of you have questions.,"Good course, not too much work, and the majority of learning can be done on your own time","This is not a good representative course of the econ department. If you can do the psets then you will do well on the exams (15 MC). However, the course and the psets do not teach you anything applicable. Only take this class if you need to fulfill concentration requirements. Do not take it for fun!!","I love this class; I heavily disagree with all the negative q-guide comments about this course that I read when trying to decide whether to take this class. The material is interesting and relevant, Miron is a good lecturer, and the course is so painless (there is no busywork). This course was 100x better than Ec 10a","You will have to take it as an ec concentrator, if you are not planning on taking ec1011, so might as well like it and make the most out of it.",Just memorize how to do all the homework problems and you'll be fine. The conceptual stuff doesn't matter.,"Professor Miron does not care about you or the course. He makes sloppy mistakes on his presentations and no effort to engage the students. Throughout the semester, explanations on pset answer keys become decreasingly helpful, let alone legible. That being said, the class is not hard if you keep up with the psets, and the grading is fair and straightforward. If you have to take it, it will be okay.","The Professor does not enjoy teaching the class and it shows, lectures are extremely boring and do not even help for the tests since they are problem set based. You have to take this course as an economics concentrator, but it is my least favorite course so far at Harvard.",Really did not like this class. It seemed like all the material was just copied from the publisher of the book. I really enjoy classes that teach us how to think and give us a broader concept of the subject material. For this class I was literally just memorizing equations.,Take it if you have to so long as Miron is teaching it.,,"You have to take it. Prepare yourself for pointless exams and no feedback given on any work you do. It is not a learning exercise, it is just jumping through hoops. Having said that Miron is actually pretty good.",Boring class. Lectures are useless. Book is useless. Only psets matter for exam material.,"Ec10 with math, everything you found interesting in Ec10 will just be repeated with math added so you probably won't find it interesting again.","If you are not required to take this course, do not take it.  You will not enjoy the class or Professor Miron.  I made the mistake of taking it because I thought I had to for my Economics secondary.  I deeply regret taking this course.  I would rather have a lower grade in another Economics course that I enjoy and has a good professor than take this class again.","If you really like economics or have a strong math background, definitely just take Econ 1011a, as that will probably be more rewarding for you. I liked the material, but the course itself is poorly set up. This course is not structured very well in terms of support for students and fostering a strong interest in the field of economics. It is sad to see that all tests are multiple choice, which made students memorize answers or figure out tricks on exams instead of learning the economics concepts. Also, I thought it was very counterproductive for students not to have access to lecture notes, and Prof. Miron's lectures were not very engaging or helpful for the material we were being tested on. Attendance dropped significantly after the first month. Also, having only multiple choice exams count towards our grade with no opportunities for partial credit for people that love economics and understand the concepts, but make some basic math errors was slightly unfair, particularly because many students do not take the time to understand the concepts and instead just memorize answers or guess.",You have no choice,great,"This class has interesting material, but is not challenging or very interesting. Professor Miron does not lecture very well, and the problem sets and exams are not challenging, so I ended up not learning as much as I probably could have. If taking this class is a requirement, and you're deciding between this and Econ 1011a, then you just have to evaluate the tradeoff – take an easy but boring class or a hard and stimulating class.","If you are doing EC, it's either this or 1011a. My blockmate was in 1011a and it is a nightmare. Take this class, learn stuff, don't drown yourself in work.","This course is not very exciting, but there are some interesting things to learn.","Do the problem sets on time, otherwise you'll be reviewing everything the night before the exam",You have to be willing to teach yourself with regards to the problem sets.,"Lectures are useless for the workbook, which is useless for the multi-choice, which (other than the copied problems) aren't too helpful for the exams","I wouldn't take this unless you need it for a concentration or secondary. Not because it is a bad class, but you can get all the same ideas from Ec 10. This class just applies those ideas to more complicated problems.",This class teaches you very little beyond applying calculus to concepts you learned in ec 10. Unfortunately it is a requirement needed to take more advanced ec courses.,"As you can tell from past years, 1010a hasn't been the most well-liked course. I think this semester was an attempt to improve the course, but it definitely didn't work. The 4 midterms and final were all multiple choice, which I thought was sort of strange for Ec. Sections were completely pset solving sessions, which I found helpful, but again I thought that TFs didn't really know what was going on with the course other than that. Lecture wasn't very helpful -- I found myself reading the textbook most of the time, which even then was sometimes confusing. If you're an ec concentrator, you obviously have to take the course, but if you're only interested in taking an ec course at Harvard I probably wouldn't recommend taking this class with the expectation of learning anything particularly insightful.",Its a great class; just focus on learning the Psets. That's the best way to study for the midterms and final; lecture is not useful.,The instructor is a good guy. The material is drudge work.,"You can have two fives on the AP exams, do Ec10 and get A's but at the end of the day Ec1010a is what it is. . .a mess. I would NOT recommend this class to anyone I love or respect in any way. This was the most miserable experience. Bless my TF, he tried, but this class is just not salvageable. I mean if you're doing Ec, great, but if not, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!","It's required for Econ concentrators, and is an alternative to Ec1011 if you cannot do multivariable. Unfortunately, that's about it.","This class is not too bad. Professor Miron doesn't inspire much interest in the subject. However, I do recommend finding a good TF and going to section weekly because that is where you will learn the most. Reading the textbook is not necessary other than for the formulas.","This class is very frustrating because the p-sets are very math based and you aren't taught how to do them.  Go to Eli Satcher's section.  That's the only thing that saved me!  He actually explains everything.  Otherwise, you're going to have to teach yourself how to do the p-sets out of the blue.  The lectures are pretty much the same as what you learned in Ec10, so they don't help with the p-sets which are totally different and on a whole 'nother level.","The class itself was not too difficult as long as you take full advantage of section and use the material provided for practice. The final exam was, however, surprisingly difficult compared to all of the psets and midterms we had. I did not feel sufficiently prepared for the final, but the curve was much more lenient than it was for the midterms so it was fine.","If the format remains multiple choice and the materials remain the same, I would tell them it was the most boring and uninspiring class I've ever taken.  It requires the least amount of work and is fundamentally flawed.","Pros: The Psets mirror the tests exactly, so you know exactly what you have to teach yourself to succeed in this course.
Cons: Everything you learn you have to teach yourself. The lectures and textbook are generally considered to be unhelpful.","This course made me switch my concentration from Ec to Gov. Even though it may seem simple because of its multiple choice exams and lenient lecture policy, it has no ""cushion"" and creates a very ""sink or swim"" environment. Although I found the material interesting and fun (especially when I understood it), lack of access to TFs (and lack of access to good TFs), unfair multiple choice exams (which encourage rote memorization over actual understanding of the material), and Professor Miron's own disinterest in the course really turned me off. What was the most frustrating was that everyone, even Miron, acknowledges that the system set up for 1010a simply doesn't work, but nobody really tries to improve it or help students who are struggling to succeed under its bullshit structure. This seems to be a common complaint about the Ec department in general, which is why I decided to get out of there. If you're an Ec concentrator and set on being one, you have no choice but to trudge through this course. Things will get better. However, if you become so frustrated with the course that you want to switch out of the department, know that you're not alone in this sentiment, and that it's completely okay.",Only take if you must.  As bad as you've heard.,The format of this class makes it pretty hard to learn any concepts whatsoever. You have to put in a lot of individual work/study to learn anything or do well,Wouldn't recommend to anyone not an Ec major,"Optional problem sets and midterms with questions pulled straight from those problem sets sounds great, until you find yourself tripping over every question on the final. And the worst part is that I have no idea what any of us could have done to be better prepared, because they tested at a far higher level than they ever taught. Beyond that very negative ending point, the rest of the class is relatively straightforward, though definitely not what anyone would call fun or interesting or engaging. It's mainly a matter of trudging through the textbook and problem sets on your own. I took the class without any previous background in economics (possible, but takes a lot of time), and found that the lectures, though dry, did help with my understanding of the material.","Professor Miron changed the format of the course to get the Q score up. All P-sets, lectures, and sections were optional. Basically you could show up only for tests and you could still get an A. Tests were multiple choice with almost half of every test being composed of questions directly copied from the optional p-sets. Miron even thanked us one day for just showing up to lecture. Overall, it was a pretty easy class for a concentration requirement.","Read the textbook. Go to section if you have a good TF. If not, find a good TF. 
Stay on top of your work. 

Miron is a dry lecturer. It's still helpful to hear the concepts over again from him, so sometimes lectures are useful. Sometimes not. 

I took this course without Ec 10a or b. (and my AP Economics class in high school was a joke). Ec1010a is definitely doable if you put the work into it.",Lecture is not great so you really have to rely on yourself to learn the material and your grade based solely on 5 tests so be prepared for that component of the course.,"take it only if you have to. Be prepared to not know much, be disengaged, and scramble to try and get as many  multiple choice questions right on every test. Not a great class.","If you took any Econ in high school, I would recommend taking Ec1010a instead of Ec10a. The extra math you use is not very hard (partial derivatives, which they teach in class and are kept pretty simple)and it saves you from repeating all the topics you did in Ec10 so you save a year.
That said, I have a bunch of reservations about this course. This year, and in years past, your whole grade is based on 90 multiple choice questions over the course of the semester. Lecture is not interesting and the professor didn't reinforce the material in a way that made students more engaged, so many people just read the textbook and did the problem sets. Most of my friends in the course really disliked it mostly because our professor seemed very detached and the structure of the course was pretty bad. But if you have to take it, take it. The material is important to learn if you want to concentrate in Econ.","The way this course is structured, your end grade really depends on the curve. With each test having half of the questions consistently drawn from your problem sets, the difference between a letter is only a question. It isn't that great and is one of the major drawbacks of the class for me. You may work really hard, but if you mess up one question on the midterm, your grade is dramatically different because of the curve.","If they don't change the structure, it is an incredibly low workload class. Lectures are absolutely useless...I don't think anyone went to lecture after the first midterm. Literally sit down the night before the exam, do the three (8-10 questions each) problem sets for the exam, and you are set. Half of the exam is exactly copied from the problem sets (literally an exact copy), and the other half is pretty much the same. And I'm not even good at econ. Literally the class is a breeze, especially if you have taken Ec 10a. No one in the class has any respect for the class at all. The difference between this and 1011a is absolutely night and day. You have nothing to gain by stressing yourself out with 1011a. Do what's good for you, take this class, and focus your attention elsewhere.","There is rigidity in the structure of the course. Pay attention specifically to psets and lectures- textbook material seems less important to the grading of the course, and often is full of jargon.","It's really not that bad.  The instruction leaves something to be desired, but it's easy enough to get through thanks to the low workload and in-class exam questions taken directly from the p-sets.  And if you are genuinely interested in economics, you will learn a lot about how math and models can be applied to the discipline.  Granted, it's not everyone, but personally I liked learning about these things.","This course will singlehandedly remove most of your desire to study economics. You'll probably do well enough and get an A range grade, but you'll feel all the excitement you found in Ec10 slip away into nothingness.",Really try to do the psets in advance and definitely take advantage of section,"You have to take this class if you're an economics concentrator, but you might be better off taking it in the Spring if the class is better. This was honestly one of the least enjoyable classes I had at Harvard.","If you like econ and you like calculus, then this is a good course. Lectures are kinda boring and long, but there is very little coursework. Tests are pretty easy",Know the problem sets very well and the exams will be doable.,"Unless someone wants an easy course to breeze through, I would not recommend this course. It will not give you a solid understanding of the material nor will it challenge you in any way to test your comprehension.",Not fun.,"Do the pests, bro!",The reshaped version of this class is not bad at all. The problem sets are optional but useful as they are quite similar to the exams. The exams are multiple choice and quite straightforward. Lectures are boring and not necessary for success in the class. Section is optional and I did not find it particularly useful.,Take this course if you have to for economics concentration requirements.,"It's required, just do it.  Nothing is really necessary except the problem sets, which are highly correlated to the exams.  Not sure why people are saying the Psets are not the exams, they are literally the same questions a lot of the time.  All multiple choice, too.","This class is a concentration requirement, so you'll have to take it.  I think it needs to undergo deep restructuring.  I do not think most kids in the class learned much, as shown with the final exam.  Due to the structure of the teaching, people simply memorize how to do the problem sets rather than learning what it actually means.  So, when the final exam had questions we were unfamiliar with, most people were unable to actually apply their knowledge to solve the problems.  Most students gave up on going to lecture by the end of the term because of its uselessness in teaching us.  One classmate actually found the lecture powerpoints on an external website.  There are no lecture notes posted online, and there are little resources for students to learn.  Since the psets are never due, students can't get any feedback on their work.  Also, since the exams (four midterms and one final) are all multiple choice, students who actually know how the material may end up getting the same grade as people who don't because there are so few questions that making small errors can leave you with the same grade as someone who randomly guesses on the exams.","This is probably my least favorite class that I've taken at Harvard. I found it extremely unfulfilling and unenjoyable. It gave me a better understanding for how math is incorporated into economics and makes it more applied, but beyond that, I didn't find many positive aspects to this class (it was also pretty easy, so that was another positive). It seems like Professor Miron doesn't really want to teach it, which definitely makes lecture unenjoyable. Sections are alright in terms of preparing you for the exams, but could do a lot more to make the class actually worthwhile. Overall, I found myself unhappy and annoyed with this course.","Much better than Ec 1011a, and more applicable. Learn more in my opinion.","Unless you are taking this class for a concentration requirement, I really would not take this class.","This class is necessary to take, but don't expect to learn much. It is very much problem based and not related to the economy as a whole. Lecture can be very boring. The material is dry, and this class made me really not like economics anymore.","It's painful, but it's necessary. Don't go to lecture; it's a waste of your time because you learn everything from the optional p-sets.",NA,"The only reason it exists in the current format has to be that Miron is great at damage control and convincing people that the only reason Q scores are so low is because of the subject matter and not him or the format of the class. With that being said, as an economics concentrator, its either this or 1011.","Miron is an okay lecturer.. He is helpful, in that he spends a lot of time going over formulas step-by-step. Still, I think Ec 10 did a better job showing real-world examples, and getting us to grapple with the theories and develop intuition. This is why lecture was boring, besides the fact that it's an hour and a half long when it could easily be 1 hour.","This is a fine class if more advanced economics is what you are looking for.  The class grade is made up of 100% exams so take that as you will.  The lectures can at times be really interesting--however neither they nor the textbook will really prepare you the exams.  Except for the final though, the exams were easy and mostly consisted of logic questions and not so much complicated economics.  Your math ability does not need to be high to do just fine in 1010a.","I did well, but didn't really feel like I learned much. I skipped Ec 10, and had absolutely no trouble in the class. You basically just had to know how to do the practice problems, which were gone over in detail in section. There was no point in going to lecture.","If you took AP Economics, not only will you already know everything this class teaches you, the problem sets and exams are still not doable because they are entirely multiple choice that test odd permutations of simple concepts. This class is the textbook taught three times- once read aloud (not kidding) during lecture, once assigned as reading, and once on the problem sets/exams. Also, the exams are consistently 40% the exact same problems from the psets so there's that. Generally lazy course all around.",The lectures don't correspond to the tests at all.,"This class is not interesting and the material can be very heavy, especially the way that it is presented in lecture.  However, since it is a requirement more an economics concentrator, there is no way around it. The one positive thing that I can say about it is that sections were very helpful and I learned a great deal more in section than I did in lecture, so make sure you go to section.",Do the psets. Get help on them. Know the concepts associated with them inside out.,"It actually blows my mind that some courses at Harvard can be so terrible. This is not a good class in any aspect, but it may be one you HAVE to take. Here is some useful advice if the course is anything like it was this year: don't buy the book, don't buy the workbook, don't go to lecture. The books are a waste of money and lecture a waste of time. If you have lecture go to the library and look up old lecture notes or google whatever the topic is for an hour and a half, you will be far ahead of any of your classmates. The topics could be interesting, but man does this course need some work.","This course is much more difficult than past semesters. This is because there are now 4 exams consisting of 15-16 multiple choice questions. There is no partial credit to provide better acuity of mastery. The grading scales have generally been 15-16 for an A, so you pretty much have to be perfect to do well on exams. The final exam is much more difficult than all the exams because the 4 midterms do not provide an adequate measure of difficulty for the final exam. 

Go to section and find Nancy as your section leader because Professor Miron most likely still does not care for this course. Without her, it is hard to tell how well you can do in this class.","A very good, straightforward course that allows you to gain some intuition about some interesting toy problems in economics. Don't have to attend lecture, but if you choose not to definitely read the book carefully and do all the problem sets. No tricks in this course, which is good.","This class is poorly run, but economics is interesting if you like economics. I probably wouldn't take it as an elective, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. They just grade kind of weirdly which is pretty annoying.",This is probably one of the worst classes I have taken at Harvard. I feel like I got a lot more out of ec10 in terms of economics knowledge.,"you have to take it, but they make it suck",Stay on top of coursework.,"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE unless you absolutely have to for a concentration requirement. I hardly learned anything in this course and requires hardly any time throughout the semester. You may feel like you are very prepared for test but getting 2-3 multiple choice questions wrong can already be equivalent to a B/B+ because the exams are so easy, and you do not learn a lot which is really frustrating. Lectures are useless. This is the first class at Harvard that I have skipped lecture for. The only exam preparation given is the multiple choice psets. There is hardly any useful supplements to help you learn.","Attend section and learn how to do problems. You can attend lecture, too.","If you want to study or do well on tests, you only have the problem sets to work with. Class and textbook are useless. Had a pretty bad experience with TF's. If you're a bad test taker, you might really struggle with this course. Do not recommend unless you really need to take it for Econ concentration.","This course was pretty painless and not nearly as boring as everyone makes it out to be. It certainly wasn't my favorite course, but manageable and helpful if you are continuing with Econ.","Absolutely hated it. Microeconomics dont make any sense, Miron is just a very boring teacher.","I recommend taking this course if you have taken AP and gotten a 4 or 5. It is impossible to succeed or pass from just lecture, but if you go to section and try hard you should get an A or A-.","The material is quite interesting. However, the class is incredibly poorly run, section is awful, and lecture is quite boring. The textbook will be your best friend.","Class was really easy, but also really boring. Lectures are not mandatory or helpful for understanding the material. Section is also not mandatory but can be helpful if you don't understand the material.",Very poorly run,"It's a class you need to take for economics, but you will end up going to 2 lectures and learning everything you can from the book","Psets help with everything a ton, and the lectures help answer questions. The new test format really helped out and decreased time requirement.","Miron is a poor lecturer who does not want to teach the class. He generates almost no enthusiasm for the already dry material. You will learn about microeconomics, but it is likely you will teach yourself what you end up learning.","Don't take this class unless you need to. As of fall '14 with Miron, the testing in this class is awful thanks to a multiple-choice only format.","go to section, go to office hours to better understand how problems are done","Unless you are required to take this, I would recommend that you don't take it. It is poorly structured  and unhelpful in learning microeconomics.","Easy. because of the pset policy. Really, really boring though.","It's exactly as described: an intermediate microeconomics course. Very useful for understanding microeconomics. It's not terribly time-intensive, though the multiple-choice-ness of the course leaves no room for error, since there is no partial credit.",The problem sets are not graded which means that you need to be prepared to keep yourself on track. The final exam was very difficult so don't take anything for granted!,There is a lot of self teaching in this class. The way the class was set up with multiple choice psets and exams made it difficult for students to really learn the concepts because a MC problem set based class tends to have students understand how to solve certain questions but unable to think more critically beyond that,"Only take the class if you're an Economics concentrator. The lectures are terrible, but the workload isn't too bad, so while it shouldn't deter you from being an Econ concentrator, it has no added value to your life.","Take this class if you don't want to go through the rigors that is 1011a. Don't take this class for fun, it is not. Take it if you want to concentrate in economics, but please don't base your concentration on this class solely."
Economics,ECON 1011a: Microeconomic Theory,Ride the curve.,"This class is as difficult as everyone says, but it is manageable to get the work done. However, I'm not sure how much I actually took away from this class regarding specific skills and knowledge. I think my style of learning fits better when I have a smaller amount of material to learn, even if the class itself is more boring. Overall though I think this class made me more excited about economics and helped me see how I could actually apply what I'm learning.","Very hard, time consuming. Take it as your main class if you're able to put some time in. I'd imagine that it's rewarding if you can give a lot to it.","This class is super hard. REALLY HARD. But you learn so much. You learn to mode, to think analytically, develop economic intuition, and work with very bright peers. Just be prepared to be painstakingly meticulous if you want to maximize the amount of utility you get out of this class (an exercise you can do in your sleep after you take this class).",Taught me how to think like an economist!,"The class is extremely hard--there is no hiding that. But you leave really feeling like you understand math and creative problem solving better. Also, a real community built on mutual suffering develops in the class so there is really no point where you feel like you are alone. No matter how hard the material is, the people and the TFs made everything sort of in reach and the class was overall a positive (though at times sleepless) experience.","Ec 1011a is an excellent course with an exceptionally dedicated teaching staff. Yes, it's a lot of work, and yes, it's difficult, but you learn how to do economics mathematically. The course is genuinely interesting because of the topics that we consider, and I'd say it gets more interesting as you go along. The last third of the course, about game theory, is especially fun. I had only taken math through 21a, and that was enough preparation in terms of calculus. However, it does seem that this class would be difficult without some statistics/probability theory -- I was simultaneously in Stat 110 (as much of the class is), but I imagine it could be a lot more confusing with 110. (Stat 104 is a very weak substitute.)","Modeling Projects - read other papers online. Sections and OH - go, they are probably more useful than lectures. P Sets - actually try to do them even though grading is really, really lenient. Class as a whole - recommended to those interested in economics and comfortable with multivariable calculus.  Hard class, but really quite manageable and doable.","Ec 1011a is something exceptional--it teaches you how to think rigorously as an economist, sure, but it also establishes a framework for how to think about problems in society and how individuals relate to one another. One of my favorite courses at Harvard, and it makes me regret not taking more Ec while here.",Great course with interesting topics. Be prepared to work hard,"This class is challenging and requires a fair amount of time commitment, but is so much more rewarding than Ec 1010a and helps tremendously in building economic rigor and intuition behind all that fun Ec 10 stuff. If you're not comfortable with multivariable calculus, this class probably isn't for you, but if you're coming in without too much economics knowledge but have a strong math background, you'll do just fine.","I took this class as an elective with no previous economics experience and do not regret it. The class's focus is on getting your hands on the real math and quantitative material economists work with. It's good practice for multivariable, economic modeling and intuition.

This year was different from others with Ponzetto teaching instead of Glaeser, so further comments may not apply to future classes. To be clear, I overall enjoyed the class; lectures were interesting and fun, and my sections were well structured. 

But in general the weekly experience was this: material was marred by disorganization and lack of structure. It was often frustrating to see that the details of the material were sometimes not paid attention to and remained ambiguous or unclear. 

The problem sets were my real complaint: often very poorly written, irrelevant, not proof read or even non sensical. (I've heard this is an unusual problem: with Glaeser the psets are instead just very hard.)

It took extra work on my part to get ambiguities cleared up and piece material floating in different places together, but in the end I did learn a lot of things (though I lack practice at doing the math due to the pset problem mentionned above). I loved the opportunity to get acquainted with the real language and thought process behind economics.","The modeling projects are EXTREMELY demanding, however as an Econ concentrator, I think this will help me much more than 1010 in marginal analysis and the development of mathematical intuition.","Do not take this class, worst mistake I've made thus far (and that says alot!).","This class is extremely difficult and unfortunately, unrewarding.  There is a big gap between what is taught in class, what is expected on problem sets, and what you are ultimately tested on during the midterm and final.  The sections and online practice problems were, for the most part, disorganized to the extreme.  Usually, I recommend tough classes because of what you take out of them.  Here, I cannot.","If you love multivariable calculus, and can think and dream in calculus, then you should take this course. You won't learn that much economics, but you will learn how graduate level microeconomics is done.","While clearly a stronger alternative to Ec 1010, 1011 leaves a lot to be desired.  Overall, great professor, great section, great tests.  However, terrible p-sets.  They are poorly written and almost impossible to understand, making is so that many students cannot complete them, turning in sub-par work.  I learned a lot and put in a lot of work, but I would be wary of taking this course unless you are willing to put in a lot of extra time into the class.","Econ 1011a is far more challenging than 1010a, but also more rewarding from everything I've heard. If you can handle the math, 1011a will give you a very practical set of skills (modeling, optimization, game theory) that can be applied to just about any economic situation.",Only take this class if you're looking for a mathematics course with a tiny bit of economic flavor. Definitely only for Applied Math concentrators rather than Economics concentration or secondary.,"This class is hard, but worth it if you like modeling/economics.  Glad I took the class and feel better for it",Very difficult class but you do get a lot out of it in the end if you are willing to put in the time and effort.,"This course is very hard, a lot of work, and often frustrating. If you are ambitious and love economics, you should definitely take it. If not, probably not.","This class is an excellent introduction to intermediate microeconomic theory and mathematical modeling. While it is extremely difficult at times, particularly in the case of the modeling projects, it teaches you a great deal. The teaching is quite effective; while the sheer breadth of the material covered made it necessary for some topics to be covered very quickly, the course's use of Piazza made it possible for students to get the help they needed. The teaching staff is very good; Professor Ponzetto is very engaging and knowledgeable as a lecturer, and quite approachable outside of class, while my TF, Andrew Das Sarma, was great at helping us understand the material through rigorous and sometimes pretty hilarious problems in section. Take this if you have a relatively moderate course schedule, and are up for a challenge; it is not easy, but if you are genuinely interested in the class, it is worth it.",Piece of cake.,"When they say that you can take this class even if you don't have extreme familiarity with mathematical concepts ""if you put in the extra work"", they really mean it. You will have to work much harder than many of your peers who are familiar with abstract math, have taken modeling/probability courses etc. And even if you do all the work needed, the marginal returns per hour of study are hardly worth it. Take 1010a, work less, and get more out of it, without loosing sleep for nothing.","If you're planning on taking this class and the most math you've taken is 21a, don't. The class will assume knowledge of proofs and some statistics, and you will feel uncomfortable asking for these concepts to be clarified when it seems like all of the other physics/stat/math geniuses in your class understand everything. This is an unnecessarily hard class and will not leave feeling like you learned a significant amount of economics.","This class is hard, but rewarding. You will learn so much in this class, but be prepared to put in the time and effort.","It's frustrating, it's angering, and it might even make you want to rip your hair out in the process.  But, it's worth it in the end.  You don't learn much new economics in this class, because that's not the point of the class.  The point is to learn mathematical modeling applied to economics-related situations, and to learn how to think about problems far more analytically.",It as incredible class if you have the time to commit to it and the math background to handle it.  I struggled but I'm definitely happy I took it.,This is a great class and the material is very well organized. A thorough understanding of multivariable calculus is definitely helpful; some understanding of real analysis and probability is also complementary.,"This class is, as most people will tell you, quite difficult. To some extent, your success may be contingent on the quality of the teaching staff.

You'll be surrounded by very intelligent people, taking a very rigorous class. The situation will at times feel intimidating, but I have to say that this was one of the most enjoyable classes I took. I honestly felt like I was learning a lot. The content is consistently engaging, though--because problem sets and section notes and modeling projects and answer keys are recreated yearly by the teaching fellows--not always consistent in quality.

From reading past Q scores, both 1010 and 1011a had very positive and very negative reviews. The negative reviews for 1011a all said it was too hard; for 1010a they claimed it was too boring. Too hard or too boring--take your pick.","What a waste of time... you don't learn anything that is not trivial. Lecture format with slides is terrible, there is no textbook, the problem sets are badly done. The material is interesting somewhere deep down, but this class will only bring you disappointment.","This is a great course. It is not an easy course. Especially near the beginning, you will likely feel lost, but by the end of the course you will see that the work paid off and will come away with a real understanding of economic modeling and a new way to look at and analyze the world. If you are willing to put in the work, definitely do this over Ec1010.","Be prepared to be lost. Completely and utterly lost. You are on an expedition towards knowledge and your instructors only have slightly more idea where they are going than you do. This class is a great class for anyone at Harvard who thinks he/she is very smart. By the end of the class you will realize you aren't. That said, it's a challenge, and when you survive it, or understand a concept, it is one of the best feelings in the world.","Do not take this class- you learn very little if you have ANY other commitments because there just isn't the time- basically, all I have learned is that YES I CAN TAKE A DERIVATIVE.  Then its just a demoralizing class and not worth taking.",Very interesting subject material.,"It's a hard course, but if you really want to get good at economic theory and/or multivariable calculus and/or economic modeling, you should take it.",I would be honest about the difficulty and the frustration that comes with a very interesting course.,Good class.  The material is somewhat bland but it is presented very effectively.
Economics,ECON 1018: Cultural Economics
Economics,ECON 1035: Market Failure and Government Failure: The Economics of Regulation,"This is not a Harvard class. It does not teach you to think so much as to memorize. Class time was haphazardly prepared. Professor Rasmusen used what one of the tutors in my house called “FSM” for Failed Socratic Method, in which he would call on students who he thought weren’t paying attention (who were normally bored and thus distracted) and asked them either very open or specific but unclear questions with one specific answer in mind. When they came back with a brilliant idea, he would dismiss it as incorrect, as it was not the one that he was thinking of. The material alone is all pretty much from Ec 10, and everyone had, I believe, taken a minimum of Ec 1010. 

That said, his research is actually quite interesting, and he pleasant to talk to during office hours.","This class won't be offered again because Prof. Rasmusen is a visiting professor, but: the class is based on really engaging and important topics, but we all kind of got lost in the middle of the class, partly due to unengaging and unfocused lectures and partly due to interjections of irrelevant material like quasi-concavity, etc. Prof. Rasmusen is full of good intentions, but could also be awkward in dealing with younger people.","You may not learn a great deal of new things in this class concerning economics if you have already taking an intro to economics class. However, you will definitely build a more nuanced understanding of basic concepts (which felt valuable), learn a few new things, and really see how economic concepts connect to the real world. Seeing how economists and government officials weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulation was exciting for me and seemed useful as a student of economics.","The topic itself is quite interesting and interdisciplinary, combining economics and public policy. However Professor Rasmusen, as a visiting professor, treated students in a juvenile fashion, failing to challenge us in class and not moving class discussions beyond the information in the textbook.","This does not necessary apply since it was taught by a visiting Professor, but one thing to keep in mind is that the class requires some understanding of intermediate micro economics. Overall, it is not a very demanding course and the professor was always interested in fostering debate.",N/A since class will not be offered in future.,"I loved this course, because I think I learned to see issues in a way that's not purely economical nor purely governmental, but both. If this is offered again by the same professor, you should definitely consider shopping and taking it."
Economics,ECON 1052: Game Theory and Economic Applications,Excellent class for students with a strong interest in Game Theory and a solid mathematical background.,Understanding the problem sets in this course is not sufficient for your understanding of all material taught in this course. Attending section is a waste of an hour and a half per week. I recommend that you buy the textbook for this course.,"Read the book’s relevant sections before lecture. Things can be extremely difficult to follow otherwise.  Take advantage of section – walking through problems interactively with Gleb was a much better learning experience that watching lecture. Fudenberg knows his stuff really well, but can be intimidating - make an effort to ask questions anyways, getting over that helped me learn a lot faster.",The subject matter for this class is very interesting but requires strict attention to detailed definitions and complex notation. This course is very tough if you aren't willing to put in enough time to read the textbook and teach yourself. The TF isn't very helpful at all with homework so you must find others to work with and be willing to often turn in incomplete problem sets.,"Highly mathematical and rigorous treatment of game theory, so make sure you know what you're getting into. It's an interesting topic, but there's not much support from Drew or Gleb, you have to go out of your very much out of your way to get help and feel prepared","It's a really neat class -- just be warned that it's also quite difficult. It's not to bad before the first midterm, but it gets a lot harder after that.","Material is difficult, but workload is manageable. Very interesting if you like Econ and Math.","I had been looking forward to this course since arriving to college, so I'm disappointed in the fact that it was not as good as I had been hoping. I find game theory to be a cool but somewhat frustrating subject--it is a lot of fairly obvious axioms that you push in circles and in messy casework in order to try to determine anything, and usually your solutions are not particularly enlightening. The course is quite easy up until dynamic games of incomplete information in like the last couple weeks, at which point it just becomes so tedious that I no longer found the subject fun. I think Fudenberg is obviously very smart but not necessarily the most patient instructor, and the assignments are for the most part not terrible. I still don't think I have properly understood many concepts in game theory, which is disappointing, though I'm not sure if that is my own fault or a flaw in the course instruction.","It's a great class with fascinating material if you actually have time to learn it. The material is pretty difficult, in that most problems are not similar to ones you've seen before (yet still have a clear connection to course material). I didn't have time for the class, so I really suffered. First half of the class is pretty easy, though.",It is a lot of work and very conceptually difficult.,"This class is super interesting and you learn a lot of useful material. If you like math, econ, and statistics, you should definitely consider this class. You get much better at problem solving and your understanding of theoretical economics improves greatly. the material is also well done, psets are difficult but not too difficult, and you learn so much in just one semester","If you enjoyed 1011, definitely take this. It's not quite as time-consuming (Psets are comparable, but bi-weekly, and there are no projects). Most of the course is purely logical thinking and some math to back it up; if you really like problem solving and are interested in game theory, this is a fantastic class. Fudenberg is great.","This class was really hard and the lectures, while very interesting, didn't really help with anything.  The problem sets were really hard and the midterm/final were impossible.  Take this class with caution.","Take the class if you are interested in Nash, auction pricing, or decision making. It's quite hard and at times brutal as a lot of smart kids took it. Don't worry too much about grading though. As a senior, I enjoyed the class and if you do the readings you will get a lot out of it.",It's really hard.
Economics,ECON 1123: Introduction to Econometrics,"If you don't have to take it for a requirement, do not put yourself through it.","Speaking as someone doing an Econ secondary that did not HAVE to take this class, you could do worse.  Lecture is admittedly somewhat boring and tends to focus on less relevant topics, but the teaching staff is excellent and problem sets are not overly painful.  The material itself is useful, and has outside applications.","Learning from Stock is an incredible experience, and it's particularly refreshing because he really likes the students and seems to enjoy teaching the class. Lecture can seem very unrelated to everything (and sometimes boring and a bit overwhelming because it's so confusing), but go because Stock is just one of those really incredible professors. The problem sets are fairly easy in the beginning but quickly become more complicated and time-consuming: use the TFs!! Generally all the TFs for this class were fantastic. This class is also just really useful because if you're studying economics, pretty much everything you do in an upper level class depends on econometrics.",Make sure to go to section (and take notes since you won't have access to ANY answers) and know the psets well. The psets aren't graded hard but the material forms the basis for exams.,"The lectures for this class are not great, but the material is interesting and so helpful in other econ classes. The teaching staff is good and accessible and the problem sets are manageable and help a lot with understanding the practical applications of the theory.",necessary but difficult,"As long as you go to lecture and have a good TF, this course is extremely manageable. If you have a good conceptual knowledge of the material, you should do well on the exams (which are very fair). It's definitely not easy but if you put time into it's actually pretty interesting! I was dreading taking this and looking back I kind of enjoyed what we learned.","While econometrics is not a subject many people find very fun, this course is not that terribly boring - the professor is the best anyone could ask for in the field - if people want to ask questions, Prof. Stock is always willing to start an engaging conversation and is curious to find out students' opinions. The class is very theoretical, but the problem sets are applicable to real life issues, which is the most interesting part.","Great course, coherent workload, extremely useful. If professor Stock is teaching it, just take it.","Contrary to rumor, this is one of the easier Ec requirements at Harvard. It's also really useful (I would HIGHLY recommend taking this class in conjunction with 970).","Boring, but in the end, a useful class. Lectures were unnecessary, but sections were helpful.",Pretty painless course - I'd recommend to anyone remotely interested as it provides some pretty useful skills that can actually be put to use in the real world.,"This class is good! Professor Stock is a pretty decent lecturer, and the problem sets were fair. The TFs were quite accessible, and the information you learn in this class is quite useful!","Professor Stock is amazing, he makes the course very applicable to real-world problems.","This class is very useful. You learn how to criticize econometric models. It is a bit dry, though. Stock is leader in the field.","Prof. Stock is great, very smart and a great guy to learn from. There is a great curve on exams, and the problems sets are graded pretty easy, which is nice because they take a long time.","This is basically Stat 104 all over again. But if you're debating between this and Econ 1126, at least 1123 will let you review your Stata skills. 1126 will let you review algebra skills which are obviously not nearly as useful. So you might as well choose this, even though Professor Stock is a bit boring.","Stock is a phenomenal professor, teaches very well and grades the class very fairly. I recommend taking the class with him if you can! I was expecting econometrics to be painful, but it wasn't at all and I attribute that to both Stock and my TF (who you should try to get if you can) John, who explained things incredibly well.","Lectures and problem sets don't directly relate to tests, but you gotta take it.","Econometrics is not always the most thrilling subject and the lectures were sometimes tough to sit through, but this course is much more enjoyable that you would think. Stock could be boring at times but overall was a great professor. The teaching staff is awesome: sections were incredibly helpful for understanding the material and completing the problem sets. The problem sets were very manageable and sometimes even fun to do, and I found the midterm to be very fair. I really thought I learned a lot of really useful material in this class and liked it much more than I thought I would.","I would not recommend taking this course unless you're an Ec concentrator. It's unfortunate that lectures are not available online, especially since lecture notes are next to useless. Find the good TFs and go to their sections. This class taught me how to BS that good regressions are bad and bad regressions are good and everything in between, which doesn't seem to be useful in a real-world setting. Exams weren't too difficult, but had some questions that unfairly fished for very specific answers.",It's not as bad as people say. But it's not like you have a choice anyways...,This class is a necessary evil,It is all about the psets,This is an easy course that fulfils the econometric requirement. No need to buy the textbook.,Professor Stock is really knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material and all of the TF's are really familiar with the material (and break it down during section) and know other real world applications too!,"This is a mandatory ec class, but Professor Stock makes it pretty painless.",Prof. Stock is a very good teacher if you want to appreciate the understanding behind the stats/psets. I cannot speak for the other teacher of the course but if you have a choice I highly recommend Prof. Stock.,Just a necessary evil. Put in the work and you will survive. Easy to get a B,"This class is great. 1123 gives you tools to analyze data from the world around and develop statistical models that are not just limited to economics. If you took Stat 104 and liked stat, but felt like you weren't really doing anything useful, this is the perfect class. There are so many application for what you can learn in this class.",This course is very difficult.,Take if you need to for ec,"This class was definitely an improvement from the past few years... but not by much. I think Stock did a great job bringing in real-world examples into lecture, but sometimes lecture wasn't as helpful in actually learning the material. The first half of the semester was straight-forward, but I thought that the second-half was poorly taught and more time needed to be devoted to that. It's a requirement for Ec concentrators, and even though I did struggle in the course, it definitely made me think more about what I want to do in the future.","This class has been one of my least favorite at Harvard thus far. I do not believe it is taught very well (apart from my excellent TF who did a great job of helping out when needed). Also, I do not believe that the problem sets prepare you much for the midterm/final.",Only take the course because you must for economics. Go to section because you will learn more there than in lecture. The lectures are confusing and unhelpful.,"This class was not too difficult. While you may get lost in Professor Stock's lectures, sections are designed in order to help you learn the material. The PSETs weren't too challenging until the end. I recommend having a buddy to complete them with.",GO TO LECTURE!! ACTUALLY!! AND FLIPPIN' PAY ATTENTION!!,"If you are in economics, you gotta take it. As an elective it might not be the most fun, but it is interesting to think in the way that econometrics gets you to consider problems and what data is telling you.","Please do not take this class unless you are an Econ concentrator (in that case, it's a requirement unfortunately.). The material is boring. Professor Stock is one of the most intelligent people I've ever met; however, he cannot teach. If you have to take this class, try to get John Coglianese as your TF. He taught me more econometrics that the textbook, psets, and lectures did.","Don't shoot yourself in the foot by skipping lecture, just done. Finals week will be hell if you do that. You can get through the midterm with the textbook but the final is a different ballgame.",Try and get Peter Tu as a section leader! Great class - really hones your Stata skills and regression analysis.,This is a dry course but I think if you focused on Stock's lectures you would get a lot of the information that you wouldn't need to read the book for the problem sets and exams. The hard part is focusing. Most of the section leaders are not great. I would go to Jessica and John's and maybe Peter's section. Avoid the others.,Stock is a great professor - enjoyed the course and I believed I gained a better understanding of how economists think about regressions and data analysis.,"You really need to stay on top of your stuff from the beginning, because the class just builds and builds. also review your stat 104 stuff, statistics is a huge part of this class. it's a  tough class but if you are an ec concentrator you have to take it. definitely make sure you do the psets out thoroughly they are really helpful","Very practical, well-taught econometrics class","Very dry lectures, learned everything in section/problem sets. GO TO SECTION","Love the material, and for most it is probably required, but the teaching is absolutely horrid.","The nature of econometrics is very dry -- it's difficult to teach it well and make it interesting -- but overall, this class ended up being better than I expected. From what I've heard about previous iterations of the course, I think Professor Stock is the best Ec 1123 instructor. He's enthusiastic about the material and tries to make it as interesting as possible, including useful and relevant applications to policy and economic trends in real life. The section TFs are all good, know the material, and are incredibly helpful -- if you never go to lecture, i would recommend at least going to section. The first part of the course is pretty similar to Stat 104 material, but the course definitely gets difficult after the midterm (all new material). If you're an Ec concentrator, it's one of those things you have to get through...but I would recommend taking it with Stock if you can.","Everyone seems to think this class is really hard, but it's not that bad if you can get to the root of what you need to do.  I'm not that great at stats, but I found this course relatively simple since all you have to do for most of it is follow a process they give you.  Just get Peter or go to his sections and forget about lecture. His one hour will tell you everything you need to know to ace this class","It's a lot of work, but probably very useful if you're writing a quantitative thesis.",Great teaching staff. Professor Stock cares about students and he is genuinely interesting in teaching undergrads. All T.Fs were great. John is incredible!!,Only if Ec concentrator.,"If you go to lecture and section and make sure you understand all of the problem sets, this class is actually pretty enjoyable. When you take a step back and think about what you're actually doing in the problem sets, it's pretty cool.","Professor Stock is extremely well-versed in the subject, if not the foremost leader in the field. His lectures are very theorhetical and often over our heads, but I think going to class helps even if you don't always understand it, because section every friday really sorted things out.",It is what it is. Intro to Econometrics. Many have to take it. Few love it.,"Kinda hard, but very useful content.","Prof Stock is an amazing professor. His mastery of the subject matter, practical experience and enthusiasm makes this course enjoyable. He is also good at explaining new concepts with clarity. The course is appropriately paced. This is one of the best courses I have ever taken.","Stock's lectures aren't great, nor are the sections. Save time by reading the book. I find econometrics quite interesting but it definitely involves a lot of technical details about things like standard errors, so it's not everyone's cup of tea. This class requires very little work (3-4 hours per week for a problem set) and is very generously graded.","This class is a bit dry during class as Prof. Stock loves to get into the theory behind every regression and reason through the math, so over half the class stopped showing up after a couple weeks. That said, you don't need to go to class to do well -- go to section for concepts and OH for psets and you'll be set. Try to get into the head TF Jessica's section -- she's an amazing teacher and very nice. Confusing concepts are cleared up in section, not class. The course is overall well-organized and the exams are very fair. Put in the time and work and you'll do well.",Don't take it unless you have to.,If you're an Econ concentrator you just have to get through this course.  Take advantage of sections.,"Take this course with Stock! I took it with Chaney and dropped it and waited - so glad I did.  Stock is passionate about the material and makes a dry subject come alive.  Way more interesting than I imagined... actually, sometimes enjoyed lecture.  Go to lecture and section and save yourself a lot of pain before the final!!!","The lectures are very closely connected to the textbook, which Professor Stock co-authored, so it is a great resource to look into if lecture was bit confusing or hard to follow.",Just put in the time to understand the methods and their applications. Attend section and do your work.,"Professor Stock's lectures are so dry, but he really is passionate about the subject and means well. The psets are actually helpful and the TFs are great, so in the end, it's worth it to take this class and learn really applicable and useful skills of econometrics.","This class is tough, but it is required for economics concentrators.  I wish I had put in more effort throughout the semester to really understand the stuff we learned because the stuff you do is very practical, relevant, and useful in many class, future jobs, and graduate work in economics.  The stuff you will learn from this class is cool and interesting.  Be ready to work hard, but put in an effort to learn the material and you will do well.",This class has a lot of work. But it isn't as difficult as people like to make it seem.,good,Make sure your TF is really good at explaining the material.,"Just make sure to really stay on top of the material. I don't think I got a good handle on it until the final exam, and as a result, I didn't get as much out of doing the problem sets as I should have.","Section is very helpful; ask all the questions you want in section! If you truly feel you are learning nothing from lecture, don't waste your time. Take advantage of sections and do problem sets and you should be okay. Also, only 1 midterm!","I was kind of ambivalent towards this class. It wasn't too difficult, sometimes I felt like I spent more time trying to figure out stata than the actual problem set."
Economics,ECON 1150: Data Analysis: A Project Class,"This is the coolest course I've taken. The teaching staff is phenomenal. You get a chance to work on really cool, real world issues, and you'll learn a ton","Sendhil is excellent at creating courses with real-world applicability.  This class is no exception.  If he continues offering it, I highly recommend you take it. Sendhil and Pascal are a great tag team. Somehow they're able to allow for a massive variety of different projects and experiences while still creating a positive experience for everyone.  Great course.","Take this class!!! If you do so, I recommend that you (1) make sure the problem you're working on matters to you, and (2) if you can pick your group beforehand that would be ideal - you will be spending a lot of time with your group. With an interesting project and a good group this class would be a great experience.","This class was pretty interesting. In giving us exposure to ""data analysis in the real world""-- it did that. Did I learn anything about the data analysis methods- not really. Was group work hard?- Absolutely especially when people had different backgrounds. Was this an easy workload class? - Absolutely. Having 30 minute meetings each week made the class very easy in terms of deliverables.","You will be assigned along with three other students to one client, and you will help that client with a data project. That's it: no lectures, no sections, just a brief weekly meeting. If you have a client with a cool project and clean data, you've got an easy, enjoyable, and unique semester ahead. If you get stuck with a bad project, things could go south fast.",By far the most rewarding class at Harvard. The combination of potential for self-improvement while completing a task for a real-world client is unparalleled.,"Great opportunity to work on very cool projects with very cool companies/organizations, under the guidance of a great prof-TF team. Students selected for the course generally tend to be quite motivated so group work is generally a good experience (based on personal anecdotes and on talking to friends).","Great course—Sendhil is a fantastic professor, and the class is very hands-on and allows you to take the initiative to learn.","Take this course if you have a good group in mind walking in. The entire course is structured as a semester-long case worked on by a group of four people, so having friends who you know and trust in the course is a good idea. Be prepared to conduct fairly in-depth data cleaning, regressions, and more rigorous statistics techniques. It's fairly low work if your group is good, but can be stressful if you don't have the right people.","It's a very hands off project and you're working with a group for the entire semester, so be wary and pick good people to work with if you can. The class involves a decent amount of statistical coding, so at least 1 or 2 people in a group should be extremely comfortable and strong in R or Stata. Overall, it was a great class -- you work with a real client and help them solve a data problem. There are some pros and cons to the lack of structure, but this class couldn't happen in any other way, and it's a great real life learning experience.",This a great class that closes the gap between the academic world and the professional world when it comes to data analysis,"Despite the drawbacks of this course in terms of organization and guidance (I would guess that these issues will be fixed soon since this was the first offering of the class), this is an ENORMOUSLY helpful class that will challenge you and strengthen your skills considerably, whether you are applied math, econ or any other concentration.","If you can get into this class, take it. Sendhil and Pascal are awesome -- you'll learn a ton.","Very unstructured course. Can be a good fit for some, bad fit for others. Not bad for its first year, but could use some improvement.","My friend liked to call this class ""Consulting-101"", which is pretty accurate. This class will give you hands on experience, working with a client to answer their question. If you're willing to put in the time, this class will be an incredible learning experience for you.","I enjoyed the ""real world"" aspect of this class, in that you get to work with an actual company on an actual project, and a lot of the companies are really cool. However, some of the structural aspects of this class could be improved. For example, having a final presentation, an individual final paper, and a group final paper all due during reading period/finals is not something I really want to repeat. But hopefully the organization of the class will improve in future offerings.","This has been my favorite experience here at Harvard, and I am pretty sure it will be the best class I take here.  This class is incredible-you are able to work with data that is normally extremely difficult to receive, engage with your team and client, and learn real-world skills for problem solving.  THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!! all ec concentrators should take it (if you make the big lottery!)","group data projects are difficult and messy and take more time than you think, but if you get down and dirty in the data you can learn a lot","Especially for this being the first year it was run, the course was quite good.  I think most likely the most common complain will be that people ran into issues with there data or things along those lines - this makes sense - it was the first time the course was run, and the instructors did not anticipate the full extent to which the other parties would delay in getting their data over.  I imagine that they will arrange things in a way so that this is less of an issue next year.  Moreover, the course is meant to introduce you to real-life data work, of which dealing with data issues is an aspect.",This class is a really cool way to get involved with real world economics. It has been an incredible process to actually come up with economic answers that have actual implications for our group's client. The group component of this class is a bit hit or miss.,"This class would be perfect if it taught students to grow up and work with other people. Or let you officially work by yourself. As is, you're just exposed to the bad, the ugly, and the uglier in people. Welcome to the real world.","This is a really great opportunity to apply Econometrics principles to real-world problems. Our client actually visited campus to hear our final presentation, and really appreciated the work we completed throughout the semester.","Possibly best class I've taken. Basically just one big project - very fun to think about, and great not to have exams and the like. Good preparation for real world. Had a really fun problem (micro-finance for me) to work on, and enjoyed the whole experience immensely.","It's not really a class, it's a project...a little more involvement would have been nice.",Class is highly dependent on the project you get. Your very likely to get a great one. Some groups had a tough time with their clients and/or data however.,This class is a challenge because the assignments are open-ended and you construct them yourself. But that's what's awesome. Someone actually reads your work and listens to your ideas. You get to have impact!
Economics,ECON 1340: World Economic History,"I never thought I'd be interested in development economics. But an otherwise weak set of economics classes this semester pushed me to take this class. And I'm really glad I did. Pretty interesting field, pretty low workload in the class in general. Robinson picks some amazing and interesting case studies as examples, and the material is very engaging. Sometimes lectures can get long-winded, but overall a great course.","While I am someone interested both in economics and history, and am a fan of Why Nations Fail, I felt that reading the book alone would have been a satisfactory experience, especially as many of the other readings are covered in other economics courses. I really respected Professor Robinson's effort as well as my TFs, but sections were generally silent and the lecture material was usually overly wordy and presented in a confusing order, such that the chronology and theme of the course were generally obstructed. Great idea for a class, but could be conducted in a much better way.",The readings are long and it would be beneficial to start a reading group early instead of rushing to start one before exams. You will learn a lot about the world and feel more educated coming out. I would take it if you are shaky on world economic events.,"Provides great insight into history while still maintaining economic cause and effect (or correlation). Covers broad sector of topics and countries/regions. Robinson is great, goes on quite a few tangents, but writes great lecture slides. Very enjoyable, fair, history class with economic undertones.  Also Prof. Robinson says ""llama"" as ""yama"" which was beyond enjoyable.",No weekly work which is great. Actually pretty cool subject matter to think about why some countries are poor and some rich and how some are outliers and were able to break the mold. Great Ec Elective,IT's really painless and easy,"This class is perfect if you want a fairly relaxed class that is also very interesting. Even if you aren't an ec major, you would probably enjoy the class. It goes over basically how and why the world has developed the way it has economically.","It's an interesting class that seems to grade tougher than most. Fairly interesting from a comparative politics perspective, but I'm not entirely sure you couldn't gain most of the ideas by simply reading Robinson and Acemoglu's book (which is worth reading).","If you are not interested in history, then you may want to shop for another ec class.",Economics 1340 gives you the knowledge to understand the causes of economic growth and the income inequality present throughout today's world.,"You should wait until this course becomes a MOOC.  The lectures readings are worthwhile, the lectures not bad, and the discussion sections a waste of time.","I thought World Economic History was a very fascinating course. The material covered was quite interesting, even though much of the course focused on Robinson's book, Why Nations Fail (he does give people the heads up about this early on). Lectures this year were an hour and a half long, twice a week. Professor Robinson has an accent and does speak a bit quickly, so it might be difficult for some to follow along. However, he makes available his slides on the course website, which is very helpful when prepping for the midterm and final. Overall, very interesting class, in which you get to learn more about the interactions between the Dutch and Indonesians in the 1600s, or England with India, or about Somalia, the Mayans, the ancient Greeks, the Black Plague, serfdom, China, creative destruction, etc.","If you take this class, make sure to read ""Why Nations Fail"" and pay attention to the course slides, because they pretty much have everything you need to know for the exams. Just be ready to spend a lot of time trying to consolidate all of the information by the time the exams roll around.","So this class covers very interesting material, but is probably the least organized class I have taken at Harvard.  The Q guide last year warned me of this, but I thought the course heads would have seen those previous comments and adjusted accordingly.  Unfortunately they did not, so while this could be a very great class, the management of the course is extremely subpar, almost to the point of arrogance.  Nevertheless, the material and subject if fascinating.","You can get away with doing none of the readings because section and exams are simply regurgitating information that was presented in class. The class is an expanded version of Professor Robinson's book. If you do decide to take the course, reading slides rather than going to class would be a better use of your time because Professor Robinson has a tendency to go on tangents. In short, if you need the credit, take the class, but, otherwise, take a class that actually makes you think and not simply repeat information.",The slides hold the answers,Wonderful way to run about the underpinnings of modern economic growth! Prof. Robinson is a great lecturer and this class gives you a very good overview of where we are today and the reasons behind it.,Terrible class and terrible TFs.,"Topic is very interesting, can be repetitive, take only if interested in content.","It will be extremely difficult to keep up with the materials in this course. It is often unclear what readings are actually necessary as Robinson picks and chooses what to discuss in lecture (and thus what is covered on the midterm and final). Although the material is extremely interesting, it will be very difficult to remember the level of detail necessary to get a good grade in the course for the exam portions. You will be asked to recall the names of authors of papers and obscure tribes they discuss; and as hard as you try to focus in lecture, it's nearly impossible to keep track of Robinson's lecturing style as he introduces tangential anecdotes and does not follow the slides.","There is a lot of potential to improve the course's structure and it may be conceived as boring, but the content is very good, interesting and in my view of major importance for everyone's general education, no matter the concentration.","A lot of reading, but really interesting and fun, not super stressful",Great class and getting to work with Robinson is amazing!
Economics,ECON 1415: Analytic Frameworks for Policy
Economics,ECON 1430: Macroeconomics and Politics,"Take this if you're serious about economics, and about potentially going to grad school down the line. The material is interesting and gives you a deep-dive into real macro theory. Be prepared to self-study a bit to keep up with the material. This class will not hold your hand; it's pretty disorganized, so you have to do what you can to make sure you're learning.",This class is very theoretical and requires a fairly strong math background in order to understand everything. Basically all we did was learn about different models. The course was very disorganized and the support provided for this class was limited.
Economics,ECON 1432: Economics of European Integrations,"If you want a course that challenges your thinking, and a great teacher who infuses you with knowledge, you should definitely pick Ec 1432.",This is an excellent course that is taught by an expert in European economics. You will learn to appreciate the academic process of writing a term paper and participating in a conference with your peers.,"The professor is very knowledgeable and he likes to incorporate current affairs into the lectures. This facilitates an easier understanding of the economic frameworks learnt in class. However, a lot of times not all of the slides were covered during the lecture, which meant that these had to be studied independently at home in order to be able to follow the following lectures.","90% of the time, you never have to do any work for this class, but if you do indeed turn up to lecture & do the readings, it's pretty interesting.","Great way to complete the writing requirement. The class is very interactive and engaging. If you actually participate in class, you'll learn a ton about European economics. I would be careful about the final paper as you need to make sure to get guidance and be proactive about it!","Interesting course, but a lot of reading. Too much.","Do the press review before each class. The discussion at the beginning of class is very interesting and useful.

Try not to fall asleep during lectures by engaging in the questions with the professor and, ideally, with other fellow students.",The assignments for the course were fair and the instruction from Prof. Kotz was excellent. The evening section times were annoying though. Would recommend taking the course pass/fail,"Take this class if for no other reason than to get to know Professor Kotz. He is the kindest, most considerate, gentle-hearted teacher I have met at Harvard, and it comes through every day in class, from his very demeanor. He will also encourage you to go to seminars by brilliant economists visiting from Europe which are highly worth attending, and I would never have known about them otherwise.","Good grades for a fair amount of effort. 
Both the professor and the teaching fellow are brilliant. The professor has worked at the board of the German central bank for several years and is a McKinsey senior advisor. He will provide you with very recent, high-quality input (e.g. Investment bank's reports about topical issues). However, the professor should speed up the course and make it more challenging","This is a good class to take for a wide range of people.  Due to the open-endedness of the assignments, you can write your papers on just about anything you want related to Europe (trade policy, financial markets, central banks, taxes, etc.).  The workload is also pretty light.",Very good class for writing requirement,Kotz is a really nice guy and a good teacher. You get what you give in this one.,"Lectures might be a bit dull at times, but it is definitely a worthwile experience given how applicable the tools one cultivates throughout the course are. Professor Kotz is a great economist and Pieter was an excellent TF whose sections were extremely useful thanks to his expertise."
Economics,ECON 1490: Growth and Crisis in the World Economy,Be prepared to give up 10 days in the semester just writing papers for this class - those 48-hour windows are short but intense.,"This course's assignment structure was very difficult - be aware that you will need to devote a significant chunk of time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to completing the writing assignments. That being said, I felt like the intensity was well worth it. Professor Jorgenson is an expert in his field, communicates some really interesting and important material on the modern world economy, and is interested in learning about you.","Again, very very dry.  Even if you are interested in the material.",Good way to fulfill the writing requirement! Take this class to get to know Professor Jorgenson!!,This course teaches a broad yet informative overview of how the different economies in the world are performing and the reasons behind them. Every econ major who want to have an intelligent conversation about economics should take this course.,"Take this if you're looking for a doable, qualitative economics course. Be prepared for ""on weeks"" and ""off weeks"" - when you have a unit paper (of which there are 5), be ready to spend 5-10 hours on it across 2 days, but you may not have any out-of-class work the following week. Always go to section.","This is a fun and interesting class, a true application of economic concepts seen throughout the concentration. Looking for a class to teach you about today's economy and remind you why you chose economics as a concentration? Look no further, Jorgenson is a world-class economist and teacher, you won't regret taking this!","Be prepared to work a lot during the writing assignments. Whilst 5 two day assignments may not seem like a lot, you almost always spend at least 1 night into the early morning hours working on it.","This is a sneaky hard class, but it's very rewarding in the end!  The lectures can be dry, but pay attention and take notes because it's difficult to catch up in the 48 hours you have to write the papers.  Definitely take the time to get to know Professor Jorgenson, his wife Linda, and his assistant Trina--go to their Halloween party!  And take the time to talk to Nihar (or whoever the TF is) about your papers and how to improve on them.  The course can be discouraging at times because the papers are tough, but in the end you'll have learned a lot about some very relevant economic issues from a professor who actually meets with world leaders to solve the issues.  Take it!","Take this if you are very interested in the topic, as lecture can get pretty dry at times. Professor Jorgenson is very welcoming and eager to get to know his students so don't be shy, get into his office hours. Attend the review sections! They make writing the essay much better and you will definitely get better marks.","This was the BEST course I have EVER taken. If you actually do all of the reading, you will likely get an A. And you will learn a TON.",This class revolves around 5 short essays that you will prepare throughout the semester. It is in your best interest to learn how to write one of these papers as soon as possible when you start the course. These are quantitatively driven papers that require facts that should be picked up on in lectures or from the readings.
Economics,ECON 1535: International Trade and Investment
Economics,ECON 1723: Capital Markets,"This class thoroughly works through many interesting and real-world-relevant problems related to financial economics. It helps students understand what options are and how to price them, what the efficient markets hypothesis really says, and how to compare theory with evidence. The class is well-organized.",Interesting topic though the lecture may not be that interesting. Exams really expect you to know a lot.,Easier if you know statistics and have sounds quantitative background. To do well in this class requires more of a quantitative background than an actual background in finance.,"Must be willing to put in time and effort into understanding the material - not hard, but not straightforward either.",This class is a good introduction to important financial topics.,"Well this class was interesting. And by interesting I mean a nightmare. As a reference, my old friend that took this class, who had over a 3.9 GPA, said this was the worst class he ever took and did the worst in. Its a very poorly taught class, and the exams this year were a nightmare. The first midterm was essentially the 2006 midterm, and about half the class studied it on the old course website. I unfortunately wasn't one of those people. And then on the second midterm he put on questions that were completely unlike all the other exams and unlike everything we learned. The average was a 45. I have never regretted taking a class more in my life.","It is a very interesting class that you will learn a lot of cool material about if you have any interest in finance. It was helpful for interviews for more quantitative finance firms, and is not very time consuming or boring. The class overlaps decently with Stat 123, so for those who have taken that before it will partially a review, often in less mathematic detail.",This course is called Capital Markets.,"I think my opinion of the class is unfortunately heavily biased by a midterm that felt really unfair and a few bad TF interactions, but other than that I thought the course material was interesting and Prof. Campbell was a good lecturer.","great class, just really hard","The class is excellent. Not only is John Campbell a very engaging professor who is clearly an expert in his field, but the homeworks and exams are sufficiently challenging without being overboard. The class forces you to think and engage with the material at a high level and does not attempt to coddle you through any of the concepts.",Homework and tests are hard but material is very interesting and useful.,Good class. Be comfortable with your math background. Definitely geared toward people who have taken 1011a an 1011b.,"Great class. You will learn very much and cover an incredible range of contents. Exams are demanding, but doable. Prof. Campbell is very nice and always helpful. Make sure you go to a good TFs for section.","GREAT CLASS!  Pretty hard for non-math Ec people, not too bad for mathy-ec people.  Good lecture, great range of materials.  Definitely an academic perspective on finance, but one that is good to have regardless of whether you plan to go into the field.  Great lectures and a manageable workload if you go to section and do the PSets well.","Not a bad class if you are interested in capital markets. Problem sets ridiculously easy, but the exam material is often subject to change.","John Campbell is a smart guy but this course seems a bit unmotivated and dry. The lecture material takes at most half an hour to read through and understand (compared to 1.5 hours for lecture). Tests are much harder than expected although everyone does relatively poorly and only gets half of the questions correct. Definitely a much lighter version of Ec 1011a but with the same grading distribution. Also, go to class because they use Learning Catalytics now",It is extremely hard.,Professor Campbell is a legend in this field. This was one of the most satisfying courses I've taken at Harvard. Overall great!,This class is so hard and the TFs are the most unhelpful I have ever had.,"Only take this class if you are super into finance! If you are, then Prof. Campbell is very knowledgable and the material is great. Be sure to try to keep up with course material also; makes it a much better experience.","Great course. John Campbell is really nice and gives engaging and interesting lectures. Problem sets are definitely doable, though exams can be a little tricky (but the curve is generous). Don't buy the Bodie Kane and Marcus textbook; it's an expensive book and I only opened it three times this semester. Save the $$$ - it's one of the more regrettable poor investment strategies I learned about from this class.",Be prepared to face very hard exams that exhibit only little relation to the lectures.,"I really enjoyed this course a lot more than I thought I would. Although the material can sometimes be a bit dry, the class does a good job of making things pretty interesting. It's a well-organized, well-planned course, which also makes it easier to get into things. I feel like I learned a lot.",learned a lot!  was interesting and not very quantitative - definitely doable.,,Campbell is an amazing teacher. Material is challenging and you need to pay close attention to every lecture. Absolutely necessary for anyone considering a career in finance.,"While this course is extremely difficult and does take a fair amount of time, it has been so interesting and has actually helped with financial interviews.",It's a good course if you really want to understand the way academic finance works.,Take it if you are interested in a quantitative approach to financial markets. it's worth the effort.,A fantastic professor teaching interesting material whether or not you're pursuing finance in the future.,"The lectures are very interesting and the course gives a decent overview of financial markets as well as finance in general. Unfortunately, the midterms (especially the second one) were very technical and only partially tested the learned materials. The final on the other hand was very fair.",Great introduction to capital markets. Campbell is great.,Not worth the time...,"This is a good class. If you have some finance background, like I did, this will help improve your understanding and make you think more about some topics you never thought of previously. If you don't have any finance background, this will give you a good introduction to some things that people think about (but it's not nearly everything). As a side note, the class has many of the smarter econ students in it.","Very interesting course. I found the subject matter to be great, and the syllabus is really a comprehensive list of topics extremely relevant to anyone interested in or considering a career in finance/hedge funds/etc. The exams were difficult though, and sometimes the questions did not mesh exactly with what was gone over in lecture. Also, the TFs were ok but not always that helpful, especially with logistical issues.","Even though it was pretty difficult, this was probably my favorite economics class.  If you're at all interested in finance, take this class and take it seriously.  Put the work in, and you'll come out knowing a lot about how capital markets work.",Not a crazy workload but the exams are HARD. If you think you want to take this class be prepared to study your ass off,Prepare to be consistently frustrated with every test you take. The feeling of failure and uncertainty is very common throughout the entire course. Time and effort is reflected minimally.,"Capital Markets was an amazing course one of the best I have taken at Harvard. Very interesting and applicable material. Not too much work, especially as an Applied Math/Econ major it was one of my easier courses. Problem sets don't take too much time and exams are fair. Lectures are great.","There's some really good stuff in the class but it's way too mathematical to be immediately digestible...Professor Campbell is an excellent lecturer and if academic finance interests you then take the class. If you just want to work in finance and learn something practical for that purpose, this isn't the best class for you.","If you are looking to take this because you want to learn about the world of finance, do not. It does little to help you in that regard.","Interesting introduction to asset pricing...first month of the course focuses too heavily on CAPM and efficient markets hypothesis, but the latter half is worth the wait. Maybe the easiest course I've taken (Gen Eds included) but does require some de minimus background in statistics (expected value, covariance, etc.). Incredibly forgiving curve, given that the exams aren't particularly difficult to begin with.","For Applied Math-Econ concentrators, this course is not necessarily difficult by any means, there's just a lot of material to learn. The problem sets, although weekly, only have a few problems each, so it's really up to you to keep up with the material.","It's a mix of the material covered in stat 123 and ec 1745, and the difficulty is somewhere in between the two as well. Great course for real life examples of financial concepts.","Campbell is the man. Take this course for him. He is a really engaging lecturer and teaches the basics of finance really well. The one major flaw of this course is that the lectures are a mile wide and an inch deep, but the tests are really detailed and computation-focuses. The second midterm was basically impossible, but the final was a lot more fair.","If you are very interested in the content and expect to spend a lot of time on it, then go for it. It is hard, somewhat rewarding, and very theoretical.",The course is challenging but it is also a rewarding learning experience.,a,"Capital markets is a great class which will teach you a lot. In addition, it does a great job of balancing the mathematics behind the theories and qualitative concepts.","This is challenging course, I didn't understand anything that was said in class and the psets always stumped me and the midterms feel impossible. That being said, I've come away with a little bit better understanding of financial institutions that hopefully will provide good returns somewhere down the line in an interview or reading an econ article or when I'm someday investing for retirement. So all in all, the class is a good investment, but get ready to invest a lot.","In a class where the midterms and final consisted of such a large percentage of the grade, one would have thought that the teaching staff might have taken more time developing the first two midterms. The second midterm in particular was very demanding.","John Campbell is an excellent lecturer, and this course is an excellent and rigorous introduction to modern finance that will be very elucidating, whether you plan to seek an internship in the field of finance or take an academic interest in the subject.",Great course that teaches you things you won't get out of a substitute course.
Economics,ECON 1776: Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,"If you have knowledge of Christianity, and have an easy time with papers, then this class is not bad at all.  Interesting information, and Julia makes section interesting and easy to conceptually grasp the material.","It creates an intersting connection between past religions and how they may/did effect previous economic thinking, however there are many difficult readings.",This class is pretty interesting.  You only have to write 3 papers that are pretty interesting and a midterm and final.,This is a unique class in the department that I recommend concentrators and non-concentrators alike to take.,"A really interesting way to think about economics and capitalism. But like everyone else will say, since lecture slides aren't posted, be prepared to type super fast.","Very interesting class if you give it the time, readings are important but engaging in section is even more important","It's an ok class, but unless you're interested in religion, I would avoid it.","Lectures and material is super interesting. Papers are difficult, but overall low workload.","Lectures are interesting, but Professor Friedman has a meandering style and prone to go off on tangents (planned tangents, that is -- there are slides prepared, although the content of the tangents are only marginally related to the material at hand, which is why they're still tangents). Sections go more in-depth than you need to know for the exams, and honestly, you don't need to do any of the reading other than the primary sources relevant to the essay topics you choose. Overall an interesting course, although grading is rather arbitrary, and like most essay-evaluative courses, it is easy to get a B+/A-, but impossible to get an A.","This was a really cool class. We looked at the works of so many interesting religious thinkers and economists, and spoke/wrote about them from such a unique perspective. It was also pretty challenging: the section discussions were at a somewhat advanced level, and the essay questions forced you to really understand these concepts and thinkers. Professor Friedman is a great, engaging lecturer, and the TFs were both so intelligent and cool. Awesome class.","The first half of the semester is a fascinating intellectual history of self-interest; the second half is a less interesting but still worthwhile account of the development of American non-elite economic thought. Only a very rudimentary understanding of microeconomics is necessary for the course, and I'd strongly recommend it to History, Religion, or Social Studies concentrators. Look over the syllabus: if the delightfully eclectic mix of texts sticks out to you, disregard the low Q scores (the course is full of more quantitative types who aren't particularly interested in the material) and take the class.","This class is fine. I expected it to have more of a modern focus (all but the last two weeks is spent before the 1950s), and I'm not sure I would have taken it if I had known its exact path. The information is not terribly difficult to grasp, and although I did the majority of the readings, I probably could've gotten by with just going to lecture and looking up the excerpts online. If you're an Econ concentrator who is looking for a light class to go towards your concentration requirements, this would be a good bet for you.","This class is an incredible blend of religious history, american history, economic history, and modern day economic policy.","Super cool material, definitely take it because it fulfills so many requirements, as least for Ec majors.","This class was AMAZING. The lectures were great and although the readings are not necessary, they were really interesting as an Economics Concentrator to understand the  fundamentals of the profession.","This is a great course if you find the material interesting. If you don''t find the material interesting this class will be the bane of your existence. Lectures are boring, no lecture notes are provided, and the assignments are very difficult. However, I enjoyed the material and loved the course overall.",Great course.  Very fair and engaging.,This course is less work than a pset based economics course however the material is dense and the TFs are not very helpful and lecture is bland. The exam and essay questions are complicated and very long.,"Great Ec Elective. Some of readings are hard to understand in detail, but section and the review sessions were awesome and could summarize them to give you the main point which is what you need for exams and papers. Great Ec Elective",Take this course! Professor Friedman is fantastic and an asset to have as a faculty advisor. He is a great teacher and makes the material endlessly interesting. Go to his office hours and interact with him-- he is one of the finest minds on offer in the department of economics.,There is a LOT of readings. Do them and you will succeed.,"Very interesting materials if you like history, economics, and/or philosophy. Keeping up with the readings will help you very much in writing the paper and studying for the exam.","It's an okay class if you're willing to learn about Puritans and Calvinism and more about religion than economics, really. Helpful if you've taken AP World History/AP European History before and know a little about Calvinism, although in this course you delve into the specifics a lot more. The emphasis on religion can get a little tiresome and repetitive, and it's sometimes difficult to see how it ties into economics.","I'm a senior taking this class for an ec secondary and would not recommend this course to anyway. Friedman is brilliant and the overarching theme is interesting. However, I would not recommend the class. Read his article on the subject and you will get most of what you would get in the class. The papers are difficult to understand and require you just to do one reading and word vomit. The exams are a lot of tedious memorization. The class is not particularly rewarding. The class is very disorganized and the section component is poorly conceived if you don't have David as your TF. If you are thinking about taking this to fulfill multiple requirements: DON'T. Rethink it. There are great ec electives and other cool CB courses. I was told not to take it (by ec, applied math, gov, and psych concentrators) and didn't listen.",This class will teach you something interesting and make you see religion from a new applied perspective.,"This is my favorite class I have taken at Harvard.  Ever, actually.  I found the material fascinating.  If you identify as Christian, this is a fascinating overview of church history, especially protestant history.  I was especially happy because I didn't feel there was a biased approach to the academic examination of Christianity.  I was worried about that going into the class, but happily, I found that there were no normative statements made about religion.  It was purely observational - examining how religion has influenced economics.  The sections were fantastic; I loved the format.  It was incredibly engaging - with debates and discussions.  And the lectures were intriguing.  I never felt bored.  I wish I could take this class again!  Yup, I loved it that much.  And I wish I could've spent more time really enjoying the readings because they were all fascinating.","This class has been my favorite Gen Ed at Harvard! At first, it seems like the class is talking about a very obscure and odd subject. However, as the class progresses, it becomes clearer and clearer all of the themes that this class covers and how it is applicable today even. I took this for Gen Ed credit and for the Ec Writing Requirement, but I was so glad that to find that I loved the class. Professor Friedman always delivered very interesting lectures and concepts. I really wish I had had a chance to interact with him.","This was a very rough class for me. Lectures contained so much content, but it was difficult to really absorb the material, especially since I was busy trying to type everything down because none of the slides would be online. Professor Friedman was very accessible outside of class with his regular office hours, and the TFs were also quite accessible. The writing assignments were particularly difficult for me, since my writing leaves much to be desired. However, compared to other courses, this class seemed to be much harsher in terms of grading, and it was even mentioned in class, that if there's anything we should have learned by the end, it is how to write. Also, the teaching styles of the TFs seemed to vary greatly. They may choose to take the big picture approach or take the close reading approach.","This class seemed very interesting at the beginning, but be carefull! It gets very repetitive towards the end of the semester. In any case, you might still want to take it because it fulfills both CB and econ writing requirement at the same time.","Professor Friedman is a great lecturer, and this class makes you think very deeply about religion and the influence of important thinkers on economics.",Stay on top of readings.,"This course surprised me a great deal and in a good way. It is not your conventional Economics Class. You learn a lot not only but the history of economics as a discipline, but also the main figures of religious thought that have shaped British and American policy and culture. Workload is reasonable and the lectures are very interesting. I would personally say that I enjoyed the first half of the class a little bit more, as the second half became a little bit repetitive. But on the overall, a solid class with a lot of thoughtful and entertaining readings.",Super interesting class. I actually wanted to go to lecture.,it is hard,"This course feels more like a Social Studies course than an Economics one. There's nothing wrong with that, and you learn some really interesting stuff about the origins of economic thinking. However, if you don't have experience reading social/political theory, this course may be more difficult than anticipated, as it relies heavily on primary texts and drawing connections between primary authors.","If you need c&b and/or the econ writing req and/or studies of the past, decently painless way to fulfill",Take if ec concentrator. Optional paper for writing requirement.,"It's a lot of knowledge offered in lecture form, but it's a worthwhile class to take once you realize how much religious influence there actually was on the economic discipline as a whole. It also explains the differences in political parties in terms of economic policies in the 21st century.","I think this class is a great western economic history through the lens of religion.  I learned a lot through this class, although it is a bit reading intensive for an ec class.","I feel like I actually did learn a lot of really interesting information in this class, but it feels kind of disjointed. Hopefully they will restructure the material. If so, I'd recommend it.","This class is more a religion class than an economics one. I gets way too bogged down in religious nuances and so many times in the term I forgot that I was taking this for ec credit. That can get really old really quickly. Lecture slides aren't posted online which wouldn't be a problem except for the way lectures are presented. There is a ton of random information that is totally irrelevant (like what specific Church authors preached at) and delivered really slowly but the actual material is sped through. 

In hindsight I would not have taken this class.",I think its a great class but the assessment process could be streamlined.  Essays seemed to be graded haphazardly,"Take during semester when you have extra time, because the reading is heavy every week and you won't get the most out of the course if you don't read everything.","This is a pretty interesting course, with a lot of information that helps to explain religious influences on economics. If you're looking for a course that covers a lot of information on the interaction between economics and religion today, this course only talks about it for one lecture. Start the last paper much earlier than the others if you decide to write it.","It's a lot harder than it looks. There's a lot of material, and you need to know all the readers and thinkers cold.","Too too much work, but definitely good material. It might be slightly boring to sit through the lectures in which the pictures of architecture of France are picked apart with seemingly no relevance to the readings, but it's great if you have a good TF who brings it all together!",It's one of the best intermediate Ec courses at Harvard.
Economics,ECON 1936: Keynes,"Great course. If you want to understand macroeconomics, and what are the differences between Keynesian and classical points of view, and you also want to learn some new fresh thoughts and ideas, then you would like the course. I'd recommend it if you economics concentrator. However, this course actually requires at least basic the knowledge of macro- and microeconomics, so if you are not an economics concentrator, and it is your first course in economics, then, probably, it is not a very good idea to take this course. By the way, attend Prof. Marglin's office hours, they are very helpful.","Take this course only if there are no other courses out there that interest you more in Economics. Professor Marglin is a great guy, but is not the best Professor out there. The models you learn are great and all, but not very applicable. Not clear exactly what you need to learn in this course, and is basically just a midterm and a final. Not very useful course, material ok, not extremely interesting, and not great sections. Exams are pretty tough, and can be hard since not clear exactly what you're expected/needed to know.","Take this course! It makes you a much smarter person. Some of the economic common sense that I once took for granted is now questionable in this course. While I still get very confused many times, it taught me how to view the economics from multiple perspectives. Prof Marglin is extremely smart! Spend your time doing the readings. It is definitely worth the time.","Professor Marglin will offer you a completely different view into economics.  There truly is no other course that presents as heterodox view to the field of economics as Keynes.  You will gain deeper insight into the various schools of economics, and it will certainly change the convictions you have about whichever school of economics you most closely align with.","Take this only if you have a genuine interest in the course. Be prepared to struggle through some very long lectures.  Try to view the course as a whole, rather than individual lectures.","This is a very interesting class; it is applicable and a good theory class. However, it can move very quickly and be quite difficult to understand. The good thing is that that seems to be taken into account in the grading on the exams.","Be very comfortable with the prerequisites, go to office hours, and you'll be fine and find this a really engaging course.","Definitely take this class!  After two years of awful boring ness in EC-10 and 1010, this very different class is a welcome addition to economics at Harvard.  Everyone else in the econ department seems to agree on almost everything, but Marglin shows a very interesting different view.  Don't be scared off by the new models being difficult at first.  Also, Marglin is really nice and is actually a farmer in his spare time and brings apples from his orchard to every class in the fall!  Due to the fact that this course is based on an entirely different set of models from the rest of Harvard's annoying homogenous econ department, this class is pretty difficult at the beginning.  As you get comfortable with this different approach, things become easier. It definitely would be good to have taken EC-10 and maybe (although probably not if you know what you are doing) 1010b before taking this course.  1010a is definitely not necessary.  Also, the tests are fair and if you pay attention in class and go to section, the tests will be fine.  Also, sometimes the 2 hour lectures can be tough and scary, but they are fine after you get used to them."

Economics,ECON 2010a: Economic Theory,"This course is hard work, but give macro the time time it deserves as well or you will pay for it later in the semester. Also, try to do the verbal problems with time limits.",Don't be overly scared by Glaeser's part and verbals or Kirill's obsession with supermodularity. You'll eventually survive.,"The Game Theory part with Professor Green was fun and interesting -- definitely worth your bang for the buck. 

For the Price Theory part, I guess be willing to teach yourself everything because you won't get much help from the professor or TA if you haven't already learned this material. If you've already learned it, I suppose the class would be interesting.","Glaeser's part takes an unbelievable amount of time. I felt like I hardly had time for any other classes. If you're a G1, you have to take it, but if you're an undergrad, definitely factor the heavy time commitment into your decision. Game theory is certainly nontrivial, but is much more manageable."
Economics,ECON 2010c: Economic Theory,Give the first part of this class the time it deserves. There is more to life than the Glaeser mid-term!,"Macro is not for everyone. David is one of my favorite teachers; he clearly presents the material, motivates it, provides context for the techniques we learn (mostly how to solve Bellman equations) from a variety of fields, and he seems to really care about the students. 

Robert is one of my least favorite teachers; unless you're already passionate about growth theory, it's simply not an interesting class. He doesn't provide any explanation for why a non-growth theorist would care about this material, and has some weird disdain for the class.",I would tell students that this is a difficult course. They must stay on top of the material in this course or they'll find themselves drowning in it to prepare for the final (which is the whole grade!).,The first part of the usual graduate macro class.
Economics,ECON 2020a: Microeconomic Theory I,"Maciej is an excellent teacher, and if you are interested in microeconomics, I strongly recommend taking this class.","Maciej is really good at comprehensively teaching the core theory of microeconomics. If you have a lot of background in mathematics, the class is really not that hard. Some students struggled though who were less prepared for this sort of theoretical work.","Unlike other courses that resemble banging your head against the wall, this class will have returns proportional to the time invested to it. There are real benefits to mastering the material in terms of policy work. Macej is great!","If you have never taken intermediate microeconomic theory, you will find this class incredibly difficult. However, I doubt I have ever had a more supportive teaching team for any course I have taken in Harvard - you will have help whenever you need it, and the structure of the course could even be adjusted to meet the class needs (For example, sections were modified a bit in the latter half of the course to focus more on problem solving). What was most helpful for me? Solving as many problems as possible, over and over again.  If you decide to take this course, it will probably be hard and take a ton of time, but if you stick with it, you'll take so much with you!","This is an informative and enjoyable course that I would highly recommend. But it is also a significant amount work, and it is very helpful to have a solid background in microeconomic theory.",This class is a lot of hard work but the syllabus is carefully constructed to help you learn. It's apparent that Professor Kotowski cares a lot about his teaching.,"fantastic course, would definitely recommend that you attend and make sure to go to lectures",Maciej is a fantastic professor. He and the TFs put a great deal of effort into teaching. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class.,"This course is a good introduction to PhD-level microeconomic theory. It's not quite at the level of MWG but is still fairly mathematical. Lots of thought goes into exam and homework problems, which is great. The material is also builds on itself nicely.

You will leave the course with a good understanding of how economists traditionally use mathematics to understand human decision making.","The course requires a lot of work, but it is overall extremely rewarding.","If you really want a solid theoretical foundation in microeconomics at the graduate level in order to do rigorous economic research, then this is an excellent introductory course to familiarize yourself with underlying concepts, tools, and methods upon which more advanced research in the field is built. If you are more interested in applied microeconomics in a specific field, then this course will likely not be so interesting and I would recommend just purchasing the textbook as a reference and jumping directly into a subject-area course (you can likely teach yourself the concepts that will be relevant to you and spend less time working on things that you will likely never use again). Again, still a great course but really consider what your goals are in taking it.","Great professor, makes material interesting, problem sets time consuming but very good","Maciej is an excellent instructor. Seriously, take anything he's teaching. He is very good at explaining complicated things in a clear and understandable way. He is also very approachable.",Good course -- worth pursuing.
Economics,ECON 2035: Psychology and Economic Theory,"This is not a good course to choose to satisfy the distribution requirement - while the material can be interesting, the problem sets devolve into unnecessarily frustrating algebra.","- great professor with a lot of enthusiasm, knowledge, and devotion to his students.
- great materials that everyone in any field, theory or empirical, should know.
- excellent teaching fellow Neil Thakral.","Problem sets are hard, but certainly worthwhile in terms of insight gained. Would recommend the lectures to anyone, even those not taking for credit.",Matthew identifies behavioral biases and offers tractable ways to model them. You could build an entire career from applying the models you learn in this class to a wide range of fields. I highly recommend taking this class even if you don't view yourself as a behavioral economist.,Behavioral Economics with emphasis on theory taught by one of the best scholars in the field.
Economics,ECON 2059: Decision Theory,Very interesting and thorough introduction to decision theory.,"If you are interested in doing research in decision theory, this course is your starting point. If you are interested in behavioral economics or experimental economics or other parts of microeconomic theory or even mathematical psychology, you should definitely at least attend this course."
Economics,ECON 2060: Contract Theory,"Interesting material, very motivated instructor, but unstructured.","In my opinion, the topic itself is one of the most interesting fields in economics. Lectures are quite entertaining. However, course isn't very well organized. Required workload is low - you should be motivated to work by yourself to get a lot from the course.","Good class for an intro to contract theory, it is geared to set the stage for research so at times it goes into a little more depth than one would want if one just wanted to get a very high level overview."

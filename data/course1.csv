APCOMP 209: Data Science,"Good to work on, important to learn","This is a very ""practical"" class. After taking this class, you will learn how to actually work with data and do statistics and machine learning properly. After taking this class and working through the psets, I feel prepared to do any kind of data science job, so definitely take this class if you're interested in something like that. I also recommend people from other concentrations, like biology or social sciences, to check this class out because you will likely be working with data in your research, and this class can really teach you how to get it done. That being said, the class wasn't very organized this year. The lectures were insipid and not very interesting, and the professor was not very good at explaining things mathematically. He was hand-wavy at times. Additionally, the course suffered some lack of communication with the students and posted poorly worded problem sets, requiring lots of Piazza posts to clarify. 

As for difficulty: The more experience you have with programming (especially Python) and statistics, the easier this class will be. The psets are bi-weekly and take around 6-8 hours to finish. I would definitely recommend going into this class with some experience because there is a lot of coding involved. Otherwise you will literally have to Google everything and the first few psets will be tough, but in the end you will get the hang of it and you will have learned a lot. 

This class can inspire you to keep doing data analysis and find some very cool patterns if you extend its lessons to your own research. I would recommend, but be aware of poor execution by the teaching staff.",Long homework's with some good lectures.,"to the extent that assignments are carefully written, this course will be fun and you'll learn some interesting stuff",Lecture is boring but we learn a lot from homework.,"Much of the learning is done outside of lectures. Read the python analysis book, it will help you save time when attempting problem sets.","It's a good high-level overview of data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.  None of the topics are covered in great depth.",Great class on the general data science process,"This was a pretty interesting course. Lectures were very relaxed and interesting while problem sets went significantly more in depth into coding and thus were quite different from what was covered in lecture--I quite liked this; others didn't. As long as you're willing to figure things out on your own, you don't need very much programming experience coming in (I had just taken CS50, and even that much wasn't necessary). By the end of the course, you will have a pretty good grasp of data wrangling in Python (and the pandas library in particular). You work through interesting examples like baseball or election statistics; problem sets this year did get a bit repetitive and unnecessarily long by the end of the semester, and there were a lot of complaints about this. The instructors are really great though and really care about the material. I'm really glad I took this course--it wasn't too much work, and I feel like I got a pretty solid introduction to data science. The final project was fun too.","Take your time with the assignments. Getting used to work with data requires some muscle learning as well, but once you got it, you got it!",The homework and project is likely what data scientists doing in their work.,"The subject of the course is incredible and there is a lot of important and interesting material to learn. That being said, the staff was highly disorganized this year, and homework assignments were full of errors.","This class is a good introduction to machine learning and big data analysis. Be prepared to spend lots of time learning python, pandas, sklearn, and few other python modules if don't already know them. Don't expect to learn the theory behind machine learning. Having a good handle on basic statistics will go a long way.","It is a pretty broad introduction to data science, and good conceptual overview of many different types of analysis (such as PCA, random forests, support vector machines, etc).","This course covers broad topics, but it offers very little depth.","This was only the second year the course had been taught and the first time it had been taught with this staff. The identity of this course is still being defined, and the experience will depend largely on who is teaching/organizing the course. The problem sets were more difficult than necessary simply because the instructions were unclear. In fact, the most efficient approach to doing the homework was to wait a few days until the early starters worked through the problem set and asked questions on Piazza to clarify the confusing parts; this is clearly unfair. Most of the value of this course comes from doing the homework. The lecture material seemed unorganized and was not taught well. All that being said, this course has a lot of potential, and I do feel comfortable working on data analysis in Python now.",Self-guided learning and an ability to solve programming challenges independently serve students well in this course. That mirrors much of real-world data science practice but will not benefit students in need of more hands-on academic guidance.,Data scientist required.,This course is too superficial for you to come away with anything. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
APCOMP 274: Computational Modeling of Fluids and Soft Matter,"Sauro really knows his stuff and clearly cares about tailoring the class to the abilities and interests of his students.  The material can be challenging depending on your background in physics and computation, but the workload was pretty low.  Be prepared to be called up to the board!",I believe this class is great if you are pursuing excellence in fluid mechanics and soft matter. The class let you explore a topic of interest with the guidance of high-level teaching staff.
APCOMP 298r: Interdisciplinary Seminar in Computational Science & Engineering,If you need a class to balance out your work load. This is it.,It is a necessary course if your other courses are rigorous and demanding.,"A great course to balance out an unwieldy or interview-ridden semester, but be warned: not really fulfilling unless you have the applied math background to understand the readings and guest lectures.",Taking this course only as a buffer to prevent you overloading in one semester.,"This is a discussion-based course providing a high level view of a broad range of topics in computational science. Doing the background reading and attending the pre-seminar discussion are really helpful in getting the most out of the seminar presentation itself. This is a good course to balance out a heavy workload, but hopefully you will find the material engaging as well.","This class is great for students whose schedules are otherwise full of heavily technical coursework. The more ""communicative"" nature of 298r makes for nice schedule balance."
APMTH 21a: Mathematical Methods in the Sciences,This course is incredible! Take it.,"This course is actually not hard at all if you do the psets diligently.  The final exam is heavily weighted to the last third of the course, so study backwards for it (I didn't which hurt me).","Overall, this class was quite more painless than it was made out to be. Of course, some of the material is fundamentally boring, but Margo actually does a pretty good job at keeping everyone engaged. I can't stress enough how much better the 1 pset a week vs 3 a week in Regular 21a is. I could usually crank out the entire Applied 21a pset in one night and not having to worry about another coming (even if they were shorter) was amazing. Also, I STRONGLY recommend that you take this class freshman year in you are placed into it. I waited a bit and regret it because I was a little rusty and out of practice. Tons of tips, tricks, and ways of thinking that I learned in high school math but had since forgotten would have been super helpful. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this class if you dont have to take it for your concentration but, if you do, it is far better than the Regular 21a alternative.","This course is very helpful for many different concentrations and it really explains multivariable well, even to people who do not enjoy math very much.","This is a great math course for those interested in the sciences and engineering. In classes like Math 21a, you may go slightly more in depth on certain specific topics, and you may learn about more of the theory behind the general concepts. However, in Applied Math 21a you really focus on the important things and you leave with a solid understanding of Calculus III.","If you take this course, expect to learn all the material through the textbook. The lecturer isn't engaging. TFs aren't motivated (and they're college students). There is no application to any fields beyond mathematics so don't be fooled by the ""applied"" label.","AM21a is a fantastic was to dive into multivariable calculus. Margo is especially a fantastic teacher, who explains well, is available outside class for help and advising, is really, really nice. If Margo is teaching again, take this class.","Only take this class if you learn and absorb material extremely quickly. The lecture format of the class, as opposed to regular Math 21a, made it harder to stop and ask questions or ask Margo to go over something. Also, the weekly problem-sets, rather than a problem-set per class, actually made it easier to fall behind on this class. Someone who learns differently (faster and more intuitively) would have liked this class more, but personally I found myself having to teach myself everything from the textbook.","Not very work intensive compared to regular 21a, well taught, and TF's are great. The optional sections are crucial to applying the material presented in lecture for problem sets. If you need to take the calc-III level, class, AM21a is the way to go for sure.",Take math 21a.,"Fantastic math class. Some of the material is difficult. The tests will thoroughly challenge your mastery of the material. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly recommend this class, especially for those considering normal 21a. If you are worried about getting the help you need in this class, or if you are worried about not having MQC, don't worry - the entire staff, including the professor, make themselves available very often - you will definitely be able to get the help you need. Margo is a fantastic professor. She is a truly unique Harvard professor. She genuinely cares about the performance of her students, and she is willing to sit down with you and discuss your performance. A great class!","It takes work to get through it, but doable",This class seems a lot better run and much easier than 21A if you are just looking to get a concentration requirement out of the way. Since the class has a rep of being easier people who aren't good at math take it so the curve is better.,"Really rewarding class. Well structured, well taught (if you can pay attention and learn well in lectures), and the textbook is well written and easy to follow. The last part of the class, chapter 13 and on, can get challenging and is explained less well. I chose to take this class over Math 21a and do not regret my decision. The applications and one p-set per week were certainly beneficial.","The course was good overall. Margo is a great lecturer, and she really cares about her students. She is always accessible, and enjoys making sure that students succeed in her class. For those deciding between this course and Math 21a, I was took both. Math 21a is better for those who need constant assignments to do well (there is only 1 problem set due a week for AM 21a, while there are 3 shorter ones a week for Math 21a), but your experience in Math 21a is highly dependent on the TF. I personally chose AM 21a because I enjoyed Margo's style of teaching more than my TF's way of teaching in Math 21a. My roommate continued to take Math 21a, and I noticed that despite the difference in the way they're taught, the material in Math 21a and AM 21a is almost identical. Be sure to do practice outside of the one problem set a week, and be sure to take advantage of office hours to earn full points on the problem sets. Exams are overall very fair, although from personal experience and from what I've heard from others, there tends to be one exam that is much more difficult than the others. Overall, however, this is a very fair and good course!","If you have to take it, it's a solid class. Otherwise, wouldn't really recommend as an elective.","Take this course over regular Math 21a in all cases OTHER THAN if you want to be a pure math or physics concentrator. I took APMth 21a while my roommates took regular Math 21a and I saw them suffer through pointless nonsense. This course is taught better by better people in a better way. It focuses on the important things and leaves you with a genuine interest in exploring its potential applications.

*Be warned that a large portion of the class has already taken multi in high school and will thus be way ahead of you if you haven't. YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN YOUR PEERS if you did not take multi in high school. Be ready for this and don't be discouraged. You can do amazingly in this course -- you'll just have to work for it.",This class is very tough.  Be ready for hard tests and to feel very lost on said tests.  Lectures are helpful but a lot of the learning is left to the textbook.,"Kind of a self taught course as you have to put a lot more individual effort compared to regular 21a, but nevertheless I'm glad I took this class.",The professor is great but it's difficult material and not so rewarding until the very end. Midterms are hard!,Margo is a fantastic lecturer who is able to keep a room full of sleepy undergraduates entertained and excited about math. Enough said.,This class is a very interactive class and teaches you about the many applications of multivariable calculus in the real world and implements huge equations into the real world.,"Stay on top of the psets and try to work them through on your own before checking your answers online/with friends, instead of just copying them. The questions on the midterms and final are harder  than the pset ones, so it's hard to do well on the tests if you don't have a really solid grasp of the core concepts. That said, Margo is wonderful and the TFs are all really good, there's a good curve, and because so many concentrations require it, you'll definitely be in class with friends. Overall, it's as enjoyable and interesting as an intro to multivariable calculus class is going to get.","It's an interesting, useful course that I would recommend for others.","Easy if you put in the time required, which shouldn't be too hard especially if you have a solid background in math.","If you have to take a math, definitely take this one instead of Math 21a, I've heard a lot of people prefer Applied 21a. The structure is a little easier to handle, but you learn just as much. It's not easy, but the professor was amazing and the coursework was totally manageable.","Definitely take this instead of Math 21a!

I'm an economics concentrator and was worried that I'd forgotten a lot of calculus since I took it in high school a few years ago, but it seemed to come right back, and the material is pretty straightforward and well-taught. There's no need for a class with homework due 3 days a week. Take AM21a!","Despite being labeled as ""applied"" math, I saw very little real-life applications of this material. However, I still think the teaching staff makes this class worth taking.","First, to address the Math 21a vs. Applied Math 21a debate: explore both options are choose which fits best for you. Both classes cover the same material at the same pace, but AM 21a has one problem set of 15 questions per week while standard 21a has three problem sets of 5 questions each per week. I chose AM 21a over standard 21a because of the structure of the homework because it fit best with my schedule. People may say AM 21a is the easier option, but I would not agree with this. Both courses are difficult. It's multivariable calculus, after all. Knowing that, be prepared to work hard and to study material outside of class in order to succeed on exams. Exams were fair for the most part, but the second midterm was a disappointment because complicated algebra for a few of the problems wound up causing a great deal of stress during the exam and led to many students underperforming. Problem sets were fair assessments, however the answers were easily locatable using the Internet, so it didn't seem like a real opportunity to learn. Professor Margo Levine is one of the nicest people I have met at Harvard and is truly enthusiastic about math. However, she is not a competent lecturer. She spent the first 20-25 minutes of every 53-minute class reviewing key concepts and material that had previously been covered in class, and reviewed, and reviewed again. This really cut into time learning new material, which was disappointing because much of the class had to be learned independently from the textbook. However, office hours made up for what lectures failed to deliver. The TFs were all undergraduates with plenty of multivariable calculus experience, so sections (which were optional) and office hours were very helpful to learning the material and solving problem set questions. Ultimately, I chose AM 21a because I had to take a math course for my concentration. I'm very pleased to be done with that requirement, though I am not necessarily pleased with my choice. It remains to be seen what the course will be curved to at the end of the semester, though there definitely will be a curve because the mean student fell at a B-/C+ going into the final exam, and that likely dropped. Good luck making your decision!","This class is good if you like to have a knowledgable instructor who does a good job of providing examples and explaining things. The TF system is also a very good way to ground your concepts. However, be aware that the class is very large and it is difficult to ask questions during the class itself.",It is a very good course that lets you learn multivariable calculus and actually apply some of your knowledge.,"If you want to take multivariable, this is a great way to do it.","Word on the street is that this course is easier than Math 21a. It's certainly nice only having one pset a week, but sometimes learning in a large lecture format can be challenging and the usefulness of section varies widely depending on the TF.",A good class to take for students who are able to reach understanding of course content independently.,"While lecture remains at the core of this class, section is invaluable to aid in the digestion of topics covered in lecture. If you decide to take this class, go to section.","The exams are brutal, so make sure to study and take practice tests.","Margo was unbelievable. I can't speak to how the class would've been without her, but on a personal level she's approachable, understanding, and wicked smart. The most important note to remember? Find a TF that works for you. Fast. Your assigned TF might not get the job done, and that's ok! Ask around, because James, Atticus, Emily and David were fantastic this semester, and there will always be options available.","Go to sections, Office Hours!! It really makes a difference.","Take this class!! Margo is a fantastic lecturer and a generally wonderful person, she does a great job of teaching you the material and is just a good person to get to know. The material can be tricky at times but it is always interesting and fun to work through so even when you get stuck on a problem, the experience is more challenging than frustrating. Office hours are fantastic : the majority of the TFs are nice people and will work with you until you understand the material, not just the solution to a specific question. Also, the community of students in this course is great and office hours were a nice time the work through psets and get to know people - I met some of my best friends in this class.  Another bonus: the workload is pretty chilled so this is a pretty low stress class - you can enjoy the experience of learning all the cool material without being distracted by stress about assignments.

In short: take this class - you won't regret it!! Definitely better than regular 21a!","Take this instead of Math 21a! Margo is amazing and cares so much about her students. Psets are of reasonable difficulty and exams, in general, are fair.",This class had some interesting material. I found that the lectures were helpful to integrate the many ideas in the class but there were a number of students who chose to use the textbook rather than attending class. The workload is manageable but you have to be willing to either stay on top of things throughout the week or be up late the night before each pset is due.,Great and useful class.,"It's hard, but interesting","Pros: 1 pset a week, section helps
Cons: lecture isn't the most enlightening, just introduces you to the topic for the most part; usually have to learn the material by yourself
The material is useful however","For me personally, I wished I had taken Math 21a instead. Though there are less frequent psets in Applied Math, the material is basically the same. However, I think math is best learned through doing problems. Because regular math practice is not required for the course, you may find that you slack off initially, and become unable to move forward the rest of the course without having to play catchup to the material.","I would highly recommend taking APM21a over Math 21a. Margo is a fantastic professor, clear, punctual, and incredibly helpful. Also, completing one longer pset per week instead of 3 shorter ones is definitely a big plus.","Very complex towards the end and very cumulative, so make sure you understand material from the beginning and middle since it will be essential for the end.",It's hard.,"This class has less of a workload than math 21a (1 pset vs 3/week), and its exams are not as long nor as tricky as math 21a's. However, the curve in this class is also not as generous, and a large portion of the kids in the class are overzealous Freshmen who have taken multi before. For someone who hasn't taken multi, this can be really discouraging and frustrating, because it creates an unequal playing field.
The good thing about this class is that Margo is extremely understanding and helpful, if you make the effort to talk to her. Make sure you go to her office hours, your TF's office hours (that's how I did my p-sets), section, and lecture, and make sure you set aside time to go through the textbook problems to really understand the material. As the syllabus says, you can do well in this class if you do enough practice problems. If you have the time/discipline, do that. If you don't, and you don't have a solid math background, I would seriously reconsider taking this course, and maybe take it after you've had time to review.","It is good for learning multivariable calculus, and having one problem set a week makes the class not too stressful.",Don't do the bare minimum and expect to get a lot out of this course. Put a bit in every few days.,"Lectures allow you to put as much effort as you may want, which can be a pro or con. If you're someone that can work well independently, then this is a better choice than regular 21a.",The structure of the course is good for people who don't want to have psets continually due in 21a.,"The material is like in any other multi-variable calc course. This was the first semester Margo headed the course, and unfortunately the scores will fall. The midterms and final were beyond difficult--and they did not measure knowledge of the material. Margo kept saying that you can do better on the next exam, and then she made the next exam worse. I spent more hours studying for this class than any other in my life, aced the practice exams and homework, and then could not do problems on the exams. This class made me feel defeated. From what I have heard from friends in regular 21a, I would take that instead if I could do it over.","I think this class manages to serve well both students who have already taken multivariable calculus in high school and want a refresher and those whose highest level math is BC Calculus (there were a lot of both and people in between in this class). I was in the latter category--and a little nervous because I'd taken time off between high school and college and had forgotten a lot of math--but I found that Dr. Levine was a clear enough lecturer that I could follow along for the most part, and assessments/psets are pretty fair. Definitely take advantage of office hours! Not sure if Dr. Levine is teaching this next year, but she and the TFs were all really helpful and patient and approachable.","Margo may not be the best teacher, but she is really nice and she tries to be accessible.",There is no calculus used the first few weeks of class.  It's a review of geometry.  I would not take this class if you are not interested in math though.,It is much more convenient than regular 21a.,"That it is a hard and challenging Course, but it is so rewarding, and I feel like I actually learned something tangible and it helped me organize my mind.","Easier than regular Math 21a. The course is easy at first, but really picks up towards the end. The last unit is hard, and the final is not easy. That being said, I'd take it over regular 21a. Just stay on top of your stuff. And GO TO SECTION. Section is so, so helpful.","This is a great class. The material is extremely interesting, and the professor and teaching fellows are always willing to help whenever possible. I truly enjoyed this class and recommend it to anyone looking to take a multivariable math class. Make sure you continue to review the material throughout the semester to best prepare for the exams, and reviewing single variable calculus prior to taking the class would be beneficial.",If you have to take it or are very interested in math then take it. If you don't have to then don't,Do the homework in advance!,"Take it over the regular math 21a. Margo is dynamic and engaging, which makes the lectures much more interesting and worthwhile. I had an enjoyable time and many laughs.",It is quite an interesting class that covers a range of topics. It is fun and engaging. It will help you learn math within the context of problems that are applicable.,"The problem sets are fine, but the midterms and finals were very challenging. Because of the way we rushed through the last chapter, I did not feel well prepared for the final.","This class is well taught, but the final exam seemed excessively geared toward material learned only at the tail end of the course. If you take this class, be sure to take advantage of office hours.",It's a good class that is a good alternative to 21a if you don't like having homework every other day.,"This is a course freshman commonly take. As a warning to freshmen, college level math is drastically different from high school level math. In college, you have to take it upon yourself to not only finish the problem sets with complete understanding, but also seek out other practice problems of your own. Some would even argue that the practice problems are crucial to solidify your understanding of the material before you tackle the problem sets. Midterms should not be taken lightly in this course either. Really ensure that you are comfortable with the material because it is often presented on exams in ways you are unfamiliar with. GO TO SECTION. Go to multiple sections! This is where you get most of the practice you need for problem sets.","This course is fantastic. Please take it. You honestly won't regret it. It is math being taught in an enjoyable way--through a practical lens and with a great structure (Margo's lectures are outstanding, she helps make complex material accessible, and sections and TFs are generally great). Having one pset per week alleviates the stress as well, and also--for me at least--helps you understand material better as once you sit down to answer the 15 questions all in one time, you really understand all that is covered and know how to relate different problems and theorems/concepts. I really liked this course! Much more than I thought I would.","I think Applied is the better of the two 21s, but still not easy. Margo isn't the best lecturer and going to class might not be your most effective use of time. Exams are NOT representative of what is taught in lecture/section, or what is on the psets.","This class will challenge you thoroughly, expose you to many real-world applications of calculus, and push you to be a better mathematician.",It's a good class and is well structured. The fact that there is only one problem set a week allows you to better manage your time. The lectures are clear and the concepts are explained well.,"I really enjoyed this class. While it was difficult, it was also extremely rewarding and the teaching staff was extremely accessible.","Brush up on your calc before you take this class! Or at least have notes from your previous calc class on hand. Get your work done early, go to section, and go to office hours! If you can't make your TF's section or office hours, the other TFs and Margo are available and happy to help.","Take this class if you're considering math or any other related field. It's a really great course that fulfills a prerequisite for nearly any math relative field you would want to pursue. Also take this over pure Math 21a, I know for a fact it's easier, covers the same material, and is more practical. Don't think, though, that you can walk in, walk out and get an A. You have to put in a lot of work to do well and understand the concepts. Also Chapter 13 is MUCH harder than the rest of the course so make sure you keep up to date with that as best you can, especially because it's the last chapter we did and everyone is sort of distracted by Thanksgiving/getting ready for exams.",Lecture for this class is not the most helpful because the professor only has an hour per day. Utilize section and office hours as much as possible.,Buy the textbook as soon as you enroll. Make sure to read it weekly.,Requires outside work to understand concepts unless you can follow lectures that are very proof-based. Lecture and midterm material do not line up; lectures based on proofs but proofs are not included on midterms.,Great class! Go to section!,This was probably one of my favorite classes but I think it's in large part due to the way Margo taught it. She is extremely enthusiastic about the topic and uses a lot of visualizations to illustrate what we're learning. The visualizations make it much easier to follow what she's teaching. She also derives in class all the formulas you use so you really understand how it works.,The material covered in this course is parallel to the material covered in regular Math 21a. I would recommend taking regular 21a if you are on the fence. The type of material taught in multivariable calculus is not so interesting to prompt much work outside of class and learning in a lecture format was not very productive for me. I think that most people would benefit from learning this material in small sections.,If you work hard and seek help you can do well in the class.  I think a lot of people liked this better than regular 21a.,"This is a fairly painless way to knock out your math requirement. I didn't find the material particularly interesting, but the course staff are committed to making the class as engaging as possible, meaning that there are plenty of great resources.","If you're debating between Math 21a and Applied Math 21a, easily pick this class. Yes, it's hard work you have to put in, and it can get intimidating at times, but the support network and teaching staff is so willing to help that it works out. It gives you, the student, flexibility in how you approach your learning - 1 pset a week versus 3 per week, and a guaranteed good professor teaching instead of potentially a subpar TF. And the TF's are very good in the class, and you have the option to go to section or not.","Take this course. It is so much better than regular 21a. You can attend whichever section is more convenient for you, psets are due once a week instead of three times a week (which trust me you'll want), office hours are so frequent and available, and Margo is amazing (as are all the TFs). This course made me consider applied math as a future study and encouraged me to look into taking applied math 21b. It's definitely a bit of a challenge near the beginning (at least for me) because I was trying to figure out how this class worked and trying to understand basic multivariable calculus concepts. However, it is so worthwhile and so satisfying to do this course and realize you learned so much!","Don't take it unless you have to. A substantial portion (if not most) of the kids in this class took multivariable in high school, so you will be competing with over-eager, over-qualified freshmen. Lecture does not prepare you for p-sets--you've got to go to section and actually open the book to complete them. Margo is really nice and willing to meet outside of the classroom, but it's really hard to make this stuff interesting. Either you see it or you don't.","Assuming that you're deciding between this course and regular 21a, forget what other people tell you about each course. Think about what kind of environment YOU will perform better in. One p-set per week is nice, but in hindsight, I probably would have done better in the class if I was doing math more than once a week. Same with lectures. It's nice that you're not going to be called on in this class, but everyone understands math differently, so if you're an interactive learner, regular 21a is probably best for you. All this being said, Margo is a very nice professor, and this class certainly has perks of its own as well, so just know what style is best for you!","FOR THOSE DECIDING BETWEEN MATH 21a AND APPLIED MATH 21a: take Applied. The caveat to that is: how good are you at teaching yourself things? If you enjoy having a flexible schedule, take applied. Lecture is not helpful but you can learn all you need from the textbook, meaning lecture isn't always necessary to attend. MORE IMPORTANTLY, you get 1 pset a week vs 3 per week in regular math 21a, meaning you can set aside 3 hours one day a week and that's the only math you'll have to do for the week, which some people really like. But don't take this if you need a good professor or struggle to teach yourself from a textbook, though the TFs can be helpful.","This was a very difficult course. It is important to make sure you understand the material covered in every lecture, rather than trying to cram for an exam. You must study consistently throughout the year and understand every problem you are doing on your problem sets to avoid stress when exam time comes.",This class isn't great but i think i would be better than regular math21a because it is much less theoretical.,"This class covered all of the topics that would be taught in a typical multivariable course and did so in a really approachable manner.  Professor Levine was great at showing where some of the concepts come from (she did a great derivation of the polar Jacobian and did a great job of developing the curvature equations, for example).  She was also very mindful of student needs; in the last unit, for example, she did a great job of summarizing all of the line integrals, surface integrals, and theorems related to curl and divergence in a way that helped me distinguish and relate them.  I especially liked the examples of how the concepts we learned could be applied to the real world.  It was nice to take a math course that showed how topics were related to tangible problems.",Take this class if you are disciplined enough to self-study a lot of the material and can space-out work on the homework throughout the week.,Take this course.,"If you want to go into engineering, you have to take the course.",Don't take this class if you like feedback or asking questions. It's very impersonal and large; and can be very frustrating/disheartening if you are have any problems understanding the material. Take regular 21a - learning in small sections is always better!,Margo is an amazing teacher!,Great course! Margo and the teaching staff are exceptionally helpful!,It is very difficult and you have to do a lot of studying on your own,Review single variable calculus before taking the course,"Overall, it is a great course, and even if you are not interested in concentrating in math or a similar field, the material taught will be very interesting.",Definitely go to lecture and make use of the TF's sections. The weeks I missed a lecture or two ended up being much more difficult with regards to the homework and preparing for the test. Margo is a fantastic lecturer and really explains ideas well.,"This class, in my opinion, is a better alternative to math21a and 19a if you are doing this simply for a concentration requirement and do not plan to move on to math21b. If you are planning to take 21b, I recommend taking 21a, not applied 21a. We do not go in depth about many of the math theories behind our work, which is great if you are stopping math at multivariable, but not great if you need to keep building upon 21a in 21b.",It's a multivariable course that allows you more flexibility in your schedule.,READ THE TEXTBOOK.,Overall good class. Difficult class but needed for concentration requirement. I would recommend taking this class over regular Math21a. Margo is a great professor and really wants to see you succeed.
APMTH 101: Statistical Inference for Scientists and Engineers,"First off, definitely ignore all of the Q Guide reviews of this class before this year - the professor has changed, and it is no longer the ""easy stat requirement for engineers"". I cannot emphasize this enough - this class is NOT an easy class. You will definitely be exposed to a variety of concepts, and by that I mean, it is like a fast-paced course in both Stat 110 and Stat 111, judging by the comments made by my stat peers as they looked at my AM 101 problem sets. This year, there was a no-collaboration policy, which means no pset-checking with your classmates to learn the material - so definitely take that into consideration as well when shopping this class. I feel like the teaching staff will be more organized and change the class a bit next time it's offered, so it will likely be better in coming years. So the only advice I have is to be wary of taking other hard classes (like physics and orgo) in conjunction with this class, as it will likely be more difficult and time-consuming than you think it will be.",This course is very difficult - section is a must.,"If Tarokh is still teaching, do not take this course (Take ES150). It was the most unorganized and frustrating course I have taken at Harvard. Not only did the teaching staff expect everyone to remember random theorems from calc I and precalc, but they were condescending when we forgot something. And if we asked him to explain a concept, he would be quite rude about it, making it seem like we were a hassle to him. Also, they would randomly make things extra credit, or optional, which might sound good, but imagine spending hours and hours on a homework assignment, only to find out after you turn it in that they are now making it optional. Also, there was so much conflicting information between members of the teaching staff as to what would be on the exams, and what information we would be given. I have not taken a worse course at Harvard. Also, it was extremely frustrating, because statistics should be one of the most useful courses an engineer can have (particularly with regards to thesis data interpretation). However, I learned hardly anything that could be applied to actual data, as most of it was entirely theoretical, and thus NOT an APPLIED MATH course.","The class was incredibly stressful. The no-collaboration policy on homework meant that it was hard to know if you were doing something wrong on the homework because you couldn't check with anyone else.  The lectures were not very helpful in giving you the information you needed for the psets and tests. Everything was graded harshly but on a curve, so it was difficult to know how well you were doing in the class because it was all in comparison to how everyone else was doing.",Prepare yourself for a lot of independent learning and a very unguided journey along this roller coaster. Everything in this class is unclear from what the subject matter truly entails to what the knowledge is necessary to complete the problems on an exam.,"Proceed with caution. The teaching staff did try to make up for some initial hardships so I will give them credit for recognizing midway through the course that change was needed. If these changes are retained next year then perhaps this course will start out on the right foot and be more reasonable. The instructors will recognize hard work, commitment to the class, and a genuine desire to learn and improve so I know they aren't heartless and were possibly overly zealous in the beginning stages of the course. They did try to rectify this as the semester continued but I would not take this course for Gen Ed purposes. Took it because I had to.",A pretty ordinary Harvard statistics class that will give you many methods and tools to do statistical tests.,"This course was a terrible experience. Between the disorganization, the unintelligibility of lectures, and the lack of communication about expectations, it was very difficult to learn the material. Manish, the head TF, is incredible and the only way I made it through this course was by attending his section and office hours. Unless absolutely necessary do not take this class--take Stat 110 if you actually want to learn the material, or Stat 104 if you simply need a stat class for a requirement.","This class was by far the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Vahid is a very nice man, but he is a hopelessly bad teacher. The number of mistakes that were made every lecture were uncountable. It was a difficult course, but really it only seemed hard because we learned NOTHING in lecture. The concepts are actually quite straightforward, but the way the course was taught presented in a completely confusing way. The TFs were helpful, but it was hard to make up for the terrible lectures. When I was studying for the final exam, I had to completely teach myself a dozen concepts from scratch because (even though I attended nearly every lecture) I felt like I had never seen them before.","The TF's attempted to put out the flames on this burning train wreck of a class, but it was beyond repair. Because few people understood much of anything and thus failed the midterms, Vahid curved the heck out of everything and added tons of bonus points, so everyone left with a satisfactory grade though not much understanding of statistics.","If Vahid is teaching this class stay away. He may be good for grad students, but he is too smart for undergrads.","If Vahid Tarokh is teaching, take Stat 110 or ES150. Do NOT take this course. Long live Rob Howe.","Don't take this class unless you have to. The teaching staff wasn't great except for the head TF Manish. For my major, this was one of two options to fulfill my stats requirement, and the other class had stat 110 as a prereq, so I had to take this. They don't let you work with anyone else on homeworks, you don't get anything out of lectures, and the only useful part of the course offerings is the section (which can be hit or miss depending on who is teaching). OH were generally useful, although it depending again on whose you went to. You better like AM 21a material, since this course heavily uses it.","This course covers a wide variety of basica statistics and provides a great overview. However, as a result exams can be difficult to study for, since there is a wide breadth of material and the material often does not build on itself (ie. there are many separate topics covered in this course). Psets and exams are fair when compared to other engineering and applied math courses, though may take longer than you think. Section is helpful, but the textbook is not. I recommend reading the textbook examples and going to section / OH for help/","not as easy as it used to be
be weary if you're just trying to get by",Hard class because its not taught well. If you take it and you're struggling read the textbook (which sometimes had errors) and talk to vahid one-on-one- usually helpful then.,"This class is easy. Take it if you want to have an easy workload and have no desire to learn statistics. However, during exam times, you will need to do a bit of cramming.","This class is definitely a challenge -- as it is currently taught, it is very tough to understand how to apply the material that is presented, or why a specific topic is taught at a given time within the course; you need a strong math background, at at least a calculus level, to be successful in the class","So many feelings about this course: Never have I become more convinced that Harvard does not value teaching or its undergraduates. 

This was a highly disorganized class. Psets did not come back in a  timely manner (because they had one poor grad student grading all psets all the time. Because the people who were teaching us the material NEVER graded psets, they had no way to gauge how well we understood the concepts.) 

Vahid's lectures had nothing to do with the psets, so sections and office hours were the only way we learned the material. I spent a lot of time reading the textbook, watching Kahn Academy videos, googling, and reading lecture notes from stat courses at OTHER UNIVERSITIES!!

Kamyar was practically useless. Manish was our saving grace.","Problem sets, while not necessarily difficult, are long and can take up most of your weekend, unless you are comfortable with submitting unfinished problem sets. Because there is a no collaboration policy on homeworks, you never know if you are doing the problems correctly and if you are stuck, you are on your own. The textbook is not the most straightforward read. Section notes and office hours are your best friends in this class.","If the course remains the same, the workload and difficulty is close enough to stat 110 that you may as well take it. I don't see any other benefit in taking this course.","I don't know if the course will be structured in the same way next year, but there were far too many whiney people. So what if the course changed completely from what the Q said last year? Professors are allowed to do whatever they want with a course that they are teaching. With that being said, lectures were not good, and most of my learning came from reading the textbook and going to Manish's office hours.",This class is proof that the teacher makes the class. I would not suggest taking any classes with Vahid - he doesn't lecture on relevant material and derides students publicly when they don't understand the material.,Do not take this course.,"Overall, this class isn't bad. Don't expect it to be easy, but you do learn a lot about probability and statistics. The exams and assignments are hard, but reasonable. If you are willing to put in the work, then you will find the course worthwhile.","The problem of unreasonable psets is compounded by the expectation that there is no collaboration in the course. The exams are hard, and I don't think they are a reflection of what one has learned. There is little use in attending lecture. A lot of lecture is spent going over proofs that are completely unnecessary in helping you to solve problems, and this makes it unbearable. I stopped going after 5 lectures, and I think this actually helped my performance in the class by not wasting my time. That being said, Vahid, Manish and the rest of the teaching staff do care about their students, and do want to help. However, there were simply not enough office hours to reflect this. Office hours were generally early in the week, far in advance of the psets being due on Monday. Also, there was constant confusion of what was expected for us to know and what would be provided to us, in terms of formulas, on the exams. On top of this, because the first midterm was a bit ridiculous and not very reflective of knowledge learned up to that point, they added a second take-home midterm, which was also very difficult. Overall, it was quite the nightmare of a course. I wouldn't recommend it.","I bet every comment says this, but there is a NO COLLABORATION policy in this course. Don't take this class unless you know that this policy has changed. Also, there were promises towards the beginning of the course that the p-sets would get significantly easier. The first p-set was accompanied with the guarantee ""I know this is hard, but the next one will be easier."" The same guarantee came with the second. And the third. But don't worry, if you hang in there it will get easier! The very last p-set was a breeze.","Never have I been more disappointed in my Harvard education. The applied math department and SEAS generally should be ashamed that this class is offered as a requirement for so many degrees. This class was genuinely a disservice to the students that took it. All evaluations in this class were unreasonably difficult and did not at all correlate to the material learned in class. It's truly a sad state of affairs when a 6 minute youtube video can teach you more than 3 hours of lecture with this professor. This class was an enormous drain of my semester and it's truly a shame that I, like so many other students, was more or less forced to take it.",It has some kinks to work out.,Don't take this course as long as Vahid Tarokh is teaching it. It was a miserble experience. You're better off taking stat 110 and getting something out of it.,"I get the feeling the course will get a low Q score.  If it does, it doesn't deserve it. A lot of students (surprisingly, engineers) came in expecting the course to be Stat 104 due to previous years.  They got a rude awakening, but unfortunately were allowed to dictate the flow of the course because they complained a lot.  Their problems would have been resolved if they read the appropriate chapter in the very readable textbook (albeit typo-ridden) rather than complaining to the professor to make the course easier.

The course was exactly what an integrated statistics course should be without being as trivial as 104 and intense as 110 - it fit the right balance.  We spent time on the important distributions (not spending so much time on extra probability topics as the first half of 110) and then went right into parameter estimation, confidence intervals, and then regression.  Rather than 104 giving you tools with no theoretical context, and 110 giving you theory with even less context for application, am101 gives the derivation of the tool along with the use.  So, for example, you will learn how to do method of moments estimation and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and then you will actually use those estimators in practice, while 110 would just move on, and you wouldn't really intuitively feel why MLE is sooooo important.

Vahid is an excellent lecturer (and also brilliant), very, very clearly wants his students to learn (he offered a ton of OH throughout the semester), Manish's section notes were invaluable, and Antonio was all-around awesome.","Disorganized, unclear expectations. Prof. started by saying ""This will be an easy class."" Turned out to not be the case at all","DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF VAHID TAROKH IS TEACHING IT. This class was by far the worst I've ever taken at Harvard and possibly the worst I've ever taken in my life. Vahid's lectures were filled with mistake after mistake after mistake because he would show up without any lecture notes and just wing every lecture. They were the most insane lectures I've ever seen and had everyone else in the class scratching their heads trying to figure out what was happening. The book was terrible too - most of the major equations had typos, and it was not written in a way for a beginner to understand. The lecture notes were just updated from last year's, so they had nothing to do with what Vahid had been rambling about in lecture, so they were pretty much useless as well. A lot of time was put into the section notes by the TFs, but they weren't great either, and it was sad that a summary of what we were supposed to have learned in lecture was all the students had to teach themselves from. Overall, this class was a terrible experience and is proof of how far SEAS has fallen. I hope Harvard puts in the effort to find out what went wrong with this class and restructures it for next year, but I don't really see that happening. A new professor will be a huge step in the right direction, so shop it if that's the case, but completely forget about the class if Vahid is teaching again. Stat 110 will be easier, and you'll leave actually knowing something."
APMTH 104: Series Expansions and Complex Analysis,"Run, run, run away. There are better way of fulfilling this requirement, and better classes to learn complex analysis- with good course materials and  enough resources to guide you through this fairly abstract topic. Head over to Math 113, Math 213, Math 55... Anything but this","If Nitin is teaching this again, take it! After the first two classes I was ready to drop the entire course, but I'm really glad I decided to stick with it at the last minute because by the end of the semester it was by far actually one of my favorite courses. Don't be put off by the awkwardness at the beginning - Nitin is a really wonderful teacher. He obviously knows the material in and out, lectures are very streamlined, and he's incredibly kind and patient. Go to class - lecture notes don't exist, even for him. Homeworks are biweekly and reasonable, the in-class assignments are dreaded but helpful, and Jon is always happy to help too. Overall, really great class.","Take this course if you feel you can teach yourself mathematics. The topics covered are super interesting, but the course is poorly organized and does not have any book or other notes to supplement lecture notes. Nitin is super helpful and goes above and beyond to be a great teacher.",This is a small course for students interested in physics and learning different areas of math. It's interesting but it caters to a certain interests and if yours don't align then you shouldn't take it.,"This course, as it was taught by Nitin, was the structured in a very unusual way. At first this was strange, but it actually ended up making the course pretty laid back and manageable, despite the somewhat complicated material; there were no stressful exams, but rather multiple 'in-class assignments'. This helps you to keep up with the material without the stress of exams. Overall, it was pretty good and I learned a lot.","Applied Math 104 covers the practical uses of complex analysis, but it tends to be a bit hand wavy on the theoretical side especially coming from a Math 23 background. The course is also not very well organized, with some parts that seem very distant from other parts. Math 113 is potentially a better option, but AM 104 is a solid 5th class, due to its low workload.","This class is pretty useful, especially if you'd like a better understanding of Fourier transforms, singularities, and some derivations that become useful in probability (convolutions, random walks).  The prof was new this year, so organization of the course is likely to improve but, in general, Nitin was very approachable and humorous in lecture.  A more theoretical analog is available through Math 115 if that's more your style.","The course with Nitin was fairly easy and deadlines were *extremely* flexible. I heard awful things about the course last year, so these reviews are only applicable if Nitin teaches this course next year. If it's someone else, take it at your own risk.","This class teaches you some really interesting information, but it's not presented in a great way. You will leave with a much better understanding of how to use and manipulate complex numbers to solve problems, but it is something you could teach yourself.",Depends on who is teaching!,"This class is taught by a new lecturer every year, so the class is not very well structured. The material taught in this class is pretty cool. I feel I have a solid foundation in complex numbers now. Complex numbers are important for a lot of real world applications. The class was not stressful at all.","Good course to take in terms of material, but lectures and class structure were sub-par.","It can be a very interesting course, but the structure was odd and slightly detracted from the overall learning experience."
APMTH 115: Mathematical Modeling,really interesting material but kind of disorganized,"Great class.  Not a significant workload for a concentration class, but learned how to approach modeling with MATLAB.  Make sure you don't put off the final individual project for too long.",this is the most useless class at harvard.,"It's not a lot of work weekly, but as you're going do pay attention to a few topics that interest you, and give them a little more attention and maybe earmark them if they're something you might wanna work on for a group project.","Please take it!! And preferrably as a junior or a sophomore! It really helps you nail down the routine and basic good habits to develop for to be excellent in mathematical modelling. The things to pay attention to, how to use different coding packages and techniques with data to asnwer a problem, how to work with other people and receive critical feedback! I loved it! If you are a big fan of meaningful teamwork, this is your class!",Professor Kuang and this course overall is excellent. You are exposed to a lot of different ways of thinking about problems and you will get out exactly what you put in regarding the material as a whole.,Great if you want to learn MATLAB and do your own stuff - could be better-organized and have more clear objectives.,The projects can be fun and allow applied math people to use the things learned in previous classes to build models.,Make sure to have some background in applied math when taking.,"Interesting, light workload. Very broad.","I am a senior who has been taking applied math courses all throughout Harvard. I wish I had taken this class sooner. It helps you view every math context in a modeling perspective. All my past applied math classes seemed to matter and make much more sense (in terms of practicality) while taking this class. Taking modeling early will open your perspective for all your future math, stat, econ, CS, bio, chem, physics courses. Don't make the mistake I made, and try to take it early, sophomore and juniors.","I took this course with Prof. Kuang, and it was great! The lectures were interesting, but the material is never tested -- no problem sets or exams. Instead the grade is based on two group projects and one individual project, were you have free reign to model whatever you like.","This course is a really great hands on introduction to basic mathematical modeling using MATLAB. The workshops and group projects were a great way to actually apply the material that we learned in class, so you will leave this class with a sense that you actual gained some tangible skills, which is really nice. Don't expect to learn any hardcore modeling/mathematics though, most of the topics covered are done so quickly and at a really surface level.","The material in the class could have been interesting, but I don't feel like I learned much. Lectures were not particularly engaging, and the professor spent time just providing the model, but not explaining how that model was arrived at, and why the parameters were chosen, or how to think about approaching a model. I was definitely looking for more of the latter when I chose to take this class. 

The in-class exercises are good, but challenging unless you have some conception of MATLAB. It's easy not to pay attention in the class, but to get the most value out of it, it's necessary to pay attention and perform the exercises.

The workload is very light for the most part—no homework assignments or mandatory sections. During group project times, though, the workload spiked immensely and many a late night were dedicated to these projects. They were also the funnest part of the class, as it was actually creating a model from scratch for a topic of choice.","Great course, please be prepared to pay attention in lecture and bounce ideas off the TF and professor!","Some lectures were cool, the teachers were great, class overall is worth taking.  Projects were graded pretty hard but by the end it ended up being very helpful.","You must be good at Matlab, not just kind of know it.",This is an amazing class! While I can say the same about a lot of classes at Harvard. This is a class where you can apply the knowledge 5 years down the line. Very applicable and interesting! Definitely take this class if you have the capacity!!,qa,Professor Kuang is a very nice guy and wants this class to be good. Unfortunately right now it is a bit unorganized and expectations aren't always clear for the assignments. The workload is very light when projects aren't due (they are all you are graded on during the semester). I would suggest starting all the projects early.
APMTH 121: Introduction to Optimization: Models and Methods,"AM 121 is a well-organized, clearly taught class with interesting material. It is not particularly difficult and all the homework and projects are quite doable. The projects are very interesting and show real life applications of the optimization theory (ours involved treating cancer and solving a telecommunications problem). David Parkes is a nice guy and a good teacher.","AM121 is a challenging but manageable applied math course with interesting material and fair exams and problem sets.  The class demands a strong attention to detail and style, particularly in the beginning, but gets easier with time, particularly if you go to sections regularly.  The extreme optimization projects will both ruin your weekend.  Ultimately though the course is an interesting and applicable overview of optimization.",Really awesome material and new for almost everyone taking it.  Definitely not an easy course - but very fair.,"This is an amazing class, albeit VERY hard. Although I probably didn't end up with the highest grade, I learned so so so so so much this semester. Parkes is an amazing teacher, his lectures are great (i would recommend skimming lecture notes before lecture so that you're able to follow lecture better). Section handouts = key to doing well in this class! TAKE AM121. you wont be disappointed. best class i've taken at harvard so far.",Interesting and useful topic though lectures not interesting. Sections and section notes are great!,Use the section notes! They are VERY helpful. Avoid section itself; it is not.,"The class was pretty meh. I took it because the Q scores were so good but I really wasn't that interested in the material to begin with. I feel like I didn't get that much out of it because I already knew linear programming from cs124 and Markov Chains from stat 110. Other than these two topics most of the course was just memorizing two algorithms: Simplex and Branch-by-bound. Memorizing all the edge cases of complicated algorithms is quite boring and doesn't feel useful because you can just look them up in the real world. I wouldn't take it if you already know linear algebra, linear programming, and Markov Chains.","Learning the tools and concepts in this course is very rewarding. Pay attention to detail on the problem sets and be prepared to dedicate a lot of time and energy to the extreme optimization projects. The course's problem sets are time consuming, especially if you aren't comfortable with AMPL - learn how to use AMPL well as quickly as possible. Overall, an extremely rewarding class full of powerful tools.","Best math course I've taken, not even close",This course is probably one of the better courses in the Applied Math department. I would heavily recommend it for all applied math concentrators. I think that it also helped with learning about basics of math programming. Make sure to start on the project early!,"This class is excellent. Not only are the professors for this course excellent, but the material will keep you continually engaged. The concepts are difficult, but there is a lot of support within the course. The projects are very interesting and you will become very good friends with the people that you go through this class with.","This course is very time-consuming and difficult, but highly applicable to a quantitative career. Some basic programming experience and knowledge of Matlab scripts is useful, but expertise in a particular language is not required. Take advantage of office hours early and often and start on the problem sets, especially Extreme Optimization, right away.",AM 121 is a solid course if you want to learn about optimization. The problem sets take a long time and sometimes puzzling but they are not difficult since you can almost always assess whether your answer is right or wrong. David Parkes did a great job teaching the course; the guest lectures were not as great as regular lectures. Lecture notes are very thorough and section notes must be read.,buy the book,"This course was not as much work as people made it seem. It was taught basically entirely by Professor Parkes, who is an excellent lecturer. The class is graded fairly, and the section/lecture notes are more than enough to get you through the problem sets. You should be familiar with latex, but the coding and actual math in this class are not terrible to deal with.",Professor Parkes is amazing!,The class is very interesting and not that difficult if you put in the time.,"AM 121 is a good class. The material isn't the most interesting ever, but it's presented in a clear and easy to understand way and you learn a lot. It's pretty cool to see how you can model problems and to see just how many interesting problems you can model with just Linear Programming. All of the problem sets and projects and assessments work together really well to make it so that you get a lot out of the material. All in all, I thought it was a well-organized, solid class - not the most amazing stellar class ever, but definitely nothing much to complain about either.",good class! learn a decent amount and not too difficult.,,"This course is awesome! The applications are super interesting. There is a programming component to many of the assignments, but the language used, AMPL, is tailored to be used for the use cases of the course (namely, to solve linear programs).  Take this course!","This is by far the best class I have taken at Harvard. It is well worth all the work as the material is extremely rewarding, interesting, and applicable to real-word situations.","Class is very useful material and Professor Parkes genuinely cares about all of his students. One thing I didn't like about the class is that it almost encourages you to just understand how to use specific tools and techniques, like a high school math class, rather than learn ""why"" they work.",This class is super well-structured. Parkes is a fantastic lecturer. It does take a lot of time though. You'll learn a lot too.,"AM121 is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Even though this semester's course was taught by Professor Parkes, he was amazing. The section material and the problem sets are extremely interesting, and the extreme optimization projects were really fun. I took this class out of interest, not for concentration requirements, and it was the most enjoyable class I had this semester. I learned a TON, and am looking for more classes to take on linear programming now.","This is just a great class in every sense. It's organized and has a reasonable work load, introduces you to a great field (optimization), and the teaching staff is great. No reason not to take it, especially for Applied Math concentrators. If you've taken linear algebra (maybe even if not) and are looking for an interesting elective, take this.","This was a pretty well organized AM class. Having CS50 (or prior coding experience) and Stat 110 (or familiarity with basic RVs and expectation) is very helpful, but not necessary. The course demands some time outside of the class (expect 7-10 hours per pset, and 10-15 hours per extreme optimization, of which there are 2). But not having a final exam (just two midterms) is very nice (and the second midterm isn't even cumulative!). The course isn't overwhelming in terms of concepts or workload, and is somewhat specialized, but it teaches a way of thinking and is a good exercise in problem solving!","Probably the best applied math I have taken at Harvard, if you are an AM major you should 100% take this course. Hard work but not impossible, fun extreme optimization group challenges, interesting real world applications. The hardest part is becoming comfortable with AMPL, but once you are, the problem sets get considerably easier.","This course3 is probably the best in the applied math department.  That being said, it is also a pretty good computer science class (which it counts for).  The professor is really good and the materials are thorough as well.  Get started on EO2 EARLY!!","This is an incredible course if you're at all interested in modeling problems such as Airline Scheduling (general allocation of resources). It's well-taught and accessible, but can be difficult at times.","I LOVED this class. If you have reservations, you should still take it. Optimization is actually pretty darn awesome and Parkes is a superstar.",a,"Take it if Yiling comes back. Her reviews were great. Until then, I don't recommend.
The subject is incredibly interesting. I was wow'ed by the breadth of applications for linear optimization at the beginning. But the course was not the same without Yiling. This semester, problem sets, especially the team extreme optimization problem sets, were huge time sinks. Lectures were largely unhelpful for completing problem sets, and TFs in section usually rushed through material in an effort to get though the huge section packets. It all felt disorganized because no one there had taught the class before.","This is a phenomenal Harvard course. It is difficult and time-consuming, but well worth the effort. It is impeccably organized, and there are tons of resources available if you get stuck. The course material in engaging.","One of the most applicable applies math classes I've taken. Some of the homework problems can be tedious though, and I wish there had been more explanation/intuition provided for the linear algebra equations they often showed us.

Overall a useful class though if you want to learn how to model linear programs and what to do when those programs get big (100s or 1000s of variables).","This is one of the few classes that you immediately feel is applicable in real world problems, and you learn how to model many real world problems. The course itself is not difficult but the assignments can be long at times. Professor Parkes is a really great lecturer and the teaching staff was very helpful.",A very interesting course. Good way to fulfill an Applied Math requirement. Decent amount of work though.,You come away from the class with a lot of powerful knowledge and tools at your disposal. But be warned that lectures were pretty dull and most learned most of the material at sections / office hours / on own.,"This class is really interesting, but can be disorganized at times. It's also fairly time-consuming, so be sure to allot appropriate time to do the problem sets."
APMTH 147: Nonlinear Dynamical Systems,"Important for physicists and engineers alike. I wish we could have gotten to talk about chaos more, and how it shows up in meteorology.",This class is not too flashy. But it is an effective and efficient tool to learn methods of solving and/or approximating nonlinear dynamic systems.,"This material of this class is extremely interesting, especially if you like thinking about problems geometrically instead of numerically. Reading the textbook really helps on problem sets and exams, and the textbook is well written.","If you're an applied math major, you'd be better off taking optimization or modeling. This class seems to focus more on physics and engineering majors. Applied math people may find this class quite useless. This class is called 'nonlinear dynamics and chaos.' But we covered linear systems for half the class and touched a little bit on nonlinear systems for the other half. We never even reached the 'chaos' part of the course.","The course material is interesting and not too difficult. Though lectures were a little lackluster and I think we could have covered more material - we didn't get to see too much chaos - overall I was pleased. Avi is very nice and makes himself available for office hours. I do feel like I learned most from the book itself, which is very accessible. Don't expect to learn much matlab. But do expect to see some really useful and interesting concepts that relate to many different fields.","This course was a ton of fun. First, the material itself was very interesting and different than what you normally see in a math class like 21a or 21b. It is very applicable to a wide range of disciplines, so really everyone can benefit from learning it. Second, Avi is an awesome lecturer and teacher. You can tell that he put a lot of effort into preparing for the lectures, which showed in how much detail they contained. He also did little things like sketch graphs in a ton of different colors, which made my notes much more useful when it came time to study. So all in all, great material, great teacher, great textbook--take this class!","AM 147 was a fun class, with material not covered in a lot of other math courses. We didn't get to spend much time on chaos, but the other material was still interesting. Avi is a clear lecturer and very accessible. The workload isn't too intense, but I learned a lot!","Its not as easy as it looks, but do-able. Workload is also moderate - high.","This course material is AMAZING. Seriously, it details such a beautiful way to describe the world around us. Like it's unreal how much I learned from this course. It teaches you how to take insanely difficult problems and analyze their components in rather easy ways. Avi was a fair lecturer. Much better one-on-one.","This class is a good way to fulfill your differential equation requirement for Applied Math if you don't want to take AM 105. The class is fairly reasonable work wise except for the exams, which are tough and don't have any practice materials to help you prepare. The section component of the class is also not great. Avi is a very helpful instructor, though, and is willing to spend a lot of time with students."
APMTH 201: Physical Mathematics I,"I would tell students that it is not as useful as it sounds! I definitely would not take this as a great useful math class that will be super helpful later on. I don't really think it will be that useful for me. It was an okay class, but if I were to only take one math class I think I may prefer to take a different one.",This is an introductory course with a lot of chance to apply what you learnt to real problems.,"As an undergraduate I felt that this course was extremely accessible with Avi (Shapiro) and Mauricio (Santillana). The course is very self-contained and although they recommend differential equations and complex analysis, Avi and Mauricio taught everything that was needed from the prerequisites anyways. The course can essentially be called ""Dominant Balance I."" You learn a bunch of methods and theory but the ultimate takeaway is that you can APPROXIMATELY solve or check for any answer to any difficult problem using dominant balance and apply simple techniques to improve the answer.","Useful stuff, although lectures were super boring...","The techniques you learn since simple, but they are pretty powerful and useful.","Class will be most useful if you use mathematical modeling in your research. Also, be sure you start your project early and define a reasonable problem with the instructors well before the due date.",This is a great course! AM104 and AM105 are not really prereqs. Mauricio and Avi are great lecturers. I never felt stressed because of this course and yet learned a lot.,"AM 201 is a pretty good course without an excessive workload. All the psets are done in groups. My only criticism would be the lectures -- they're very disorganized, and often you're better off just reading the online notes.","Applied Math 201 is an introduction to approximation methods with a focus on their applications in the sciences.  The workload was very reasonable.  Even during the semester I took the class, I found that the topics we learned helped me with my physics courses and directly impacted my research.  I would definitely recommend the course to students interested in theoretical physics.",This is a great class to take if you are interested in getting to know how to use dominant balance to give good approximate solutions to problems that are hard to solve exactly otherwise. It is also really fun to work on psets in groups.,"Work load is kinda heavy, mostly group work for problem sets."
APMTH 203: Introduction to Disordered Systems and Stochastic Processes,it is a really nice course to broaden our view even if we are not working on physics or biology.,This class was great. Ariel is a good teacher getting better by the day. You should definitely take a class with him if you have the chance. The class was very interesting and accessible. Definitely take it if you want an introduction to stochastic processes with applications in physics.,This course was challenging but extremely interesting. Work with other students on the problem sets.,Amazing and unique selection of topics. And Prof. Amir is an excellent teacher. Highly recommended.,It's harder than the course description implies (or implied).
APMTH 205: Advanced Scientific Computing: Numerical Methods,Important class - you learn the important methods,"4/5 difficulty, ~10-15 hours per pset

This was actually a pretty good course for numerical methods. It's pretty well-taught, and Prof. Rycroft gives good explanations for all the math behind the algorithms. The slides are also excellent and help clarify things when lecture is hard to follow. Beware of the homework assignments. They can take a surprisingly long time, especially because bugs in numerical algorithms are extremely frustrating. Be very careful while writing code and be sure to check all the little pieces, and watching out for pass-by-reference things. If you can, start early because debugging is very frustrating. Despite struggling on the psets, I actually liked this class and felt like I learned quite a bit from it.","If you like coding functions that have already been written in Python or MATLAB then AM 205 is for you. If you'd rather take a class where the material you learn will be applicable later on in life, then find another course.",You must be extremely confident with PDEs to take this course. It is tough and if your not prepared you will not be able to complete the assignments.,Material is so important and enjoyable,"Time consuming, but teaches good subjects","It's a manageable course that covers a good amount of material on ODE, regression, interpolation, lin alg, and spectral analysis. The course is very much applied and focused around programming, with proofs as necessary. The course emphasizes breadth over depth.","This course is pretty interesting, but not sure how applicable the methods are.",You learn a lot of good stuff!,"This course provides a broad introduction to fundamental concepts in applied mathematics. I found it valuable, though the lectures were fast paced. Therefore, I recommend supplementing Chris' lectures with those from the previous year, when the course was taught by David Knezevic (videos available online). If you have studied mathematics or physics formally, this course will not be too much of a challenge. If you come from another discipline, or have not seen the prerequisite material in a while, this may be difficult, but definitely still doable.",fun class.,This class is quite challenging. A lot of material is covered very quickly. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on assignments and expect to get little to no sleep during the 24 hour midterm. You learn a lot of useful stuff though.
"APPHY 50a: Physics as a Foundation for Science and Engineering, Part I","Great class, the best part is learning to be a productive member of a team and have fun creating practical physics projects.","I think that this is a good class for kids not very interesting in physics but either need to take a physics class or enjoy working on projects. I think for students actually interested in physics, the 12 or 15 tracks might be better.",Take this course it is unlike any other course you will take. You will enjoy learning and growing in your physics understanding.,"This is the best way to complete the physics requirement with one caveat: if you really like physics or really want to know  great deal of physics, this is not the class.",I would tell them that it is a great course to take if they are very self-starting learners.,You need to be willing to work,This is the best physics alternative if you want a fun class where you learn a good amount and is very easy grade-wise. Don't take it if you don't like working with teams or if you can't learn on your own.,You'll learn a lot in this class as long as you're willing to put in the effort!,"It's definitely better than learning physics in a lecture based way, but it's still a physics class.",It is a great course to broaden your physical knowledge and also to develop your teamwork skills.,"Take it. It is much better than any alternative to fulfill recs you have and it is such a supportive environment. You'll have to self teach a bit, but you will learn. you will also have the satisfaction of building things with your bare hands and being proud of yourself.","To be honest, this class has a great concept and I was really enamored with the philosophy behind it - that we could actually learn physics through actual physics projects. However, the execution wasn't the best. The readings were not helpful, and we didn't really learn much in class. I would shop the other options, but it's likely that AP50 is the best option for pre-meds trying to fulfill the physics requirement.","AP50a was an absolute joy. The teaching staff is fantastic and really makes this class more than just than a course, but an actual pleasant and enjoyable learning experience. The work is quite manageable, though some weeks are busier than others (there were some weeks that you had two reading assignments and the project proposal and contract due, and then a p-set due the following week; whereas other weeks, there were no assignments) so you do need to plan ahead (but this info is clearly detailed in the course syllabus-- including what activities we'll do in class for the semester). In addition, some of the work can be a little complex and not having lectures means that you need to do the learning by yourself. This is where office hours (and there were so many of them!) will come in handy but it's certainly the kind of thing that you will get out of it what you put into it. It really is worth putting in the time and if you do take this course, you should really strive to put in your full efforts!","Most painless way to kill the physics requirement if you're premed but don't expect to have much real knowledge of physics afterward, unless you work extra hard. I recommend that you start assignments early and seek out extra help/resources if you want to really learn. The projects were pretty fun. Kelly is super helpful. The TFs were pretty hit or miss, find a TF that is really helpful and cling to them, even if they aren't assigned to you.",Don't take this if you don't want to spend a lot of time working on group projects outside of class.,"Definitely take this course if you want to try working in teams and physically building tangible things. In terms of learning physics, not everything will stick (so if you're premed, maybe this isn't the course for you) but if you're interested in learning real world applications of physics.",This is a great class if you are okay with working in groups! By far best way to fulfill physics requirement.,great class take it,Easiest perhaps most enriching way to get that physics credit,"This is a fantastic, hands on, project and team based course that is an easy time for both science concentrators and gen ed seekers alike. The course work is not difficult, but you learn a wide range of things, and traditional learning is thrown out the window. You really take control of what you learn, spend more time on doing than passive learning, and there are no lectures or section.","The project-based teamwork component is the best part of this class and should honestly be a more common feature across all college courses. You get to learn a lot about yourself and working in a team. The 3 hour classes where you just work through problems at a glacial pace can be frustrating. But feeling like you walk away with very little new knowledge is rather disappointing, even if you got an A. This class is too easy to be good.","This is a different alternative to Physics 12 or 15. Students need to be self-motivated in order to succeed, and working as a team is essential to doing well. The projects are interesting but require substantial outside of class work, but for people who prefer hands-on learning or want to get into a design shop, this class is awesome.","This class was great. However, the material is difficult and even though I put in a lot of effort, I don't believe that I really learned much of the material, or could apply it outside of this class.",Keep up with the readings. Find a method and stick to it.,"If you're reading this post trying to decide between PS2 or AP50a I'll break it down for you real quick. If you are a ""physic/engineering"" person take PS2. You will not get the foundational physics you need in AP50a in order to excel in upper level physic/engineering classes. If you are pre-med trying to get a good mark... take AP50a. It's honestly an enjoyable class. You will learn a bit about physics if you choose to and you will work on three cool projects. No exams. Problem Sets are graded on effort. Profs and TFs are really nice and cool. But you will not come away with the same physics foundation at PS2.","This course has a good heart, but is incredibly disorganized. I would wait a few years for the course to cement itself more before taking it.",A great way to fill the Physics requirement if you don't want to get deep into the math behind it.,"It's great to take if you aren't sure how strong you are with physics and is a nice alternative to the other introductory physics courses. That being said, the course is sometimes hard to manage when they have multiple components (quizzes, psets, group projects) with close deadlines, and some of the organizational issues can be frustrating. It's hard to tell how well you're doing in the course, and it's a lot of independent learning/work to grasp physics concepts.","If you enjoy following orders or else being marked off because of it this is your course.  Yes you get to design projects, but that is such a small and easy part of the course that it does not dominate my view of this course.  Perhaps if there was an actual structure to the grading in this course rather than an arbitrary grading that you don't know what you will get on anything until it is returned this course would be more enjoyable.",This class is a fun way to explore physics concepts through projects designed to apply these physics concepts to real-world situations.,"If you are looking for an easy way to learn physics as a premed, take this class!! The projects and assignments can seem dumb at times, but if you do the work you will for sure get an A. Like I would be pissed if I got even an A- in this class. Honestly, I feel like I'm learning enough physics for the MCAT which is all I'll ever need physics for anyways so I don't really care that I'm not learning more advanced shit. Also you will not ever do hard math so don't worry about that.","Don't take this class if you really want to learn physics. The fact of the matter is that when you have three other classes that demand a lot from you, you aren't going to put the effort into this class. It's also so unorganized, which is frustrating.","If you put effort in on the readings and problem sets, it is not a difficult class.","This class is horrendous. 

It focuses on the development of new teaching methods ('flipped classroom', 'online learning', 'applications focus'), under the assumption that they will be better and help students learn. The reality is that the new methods are ineffective and frustrating for us. The technology solves no problems, and instead creates new issues.

Meanwhile, Eric Mazur uses his students as guinea pigs in a flawed experiment, and you even feel like you are being watched as observers frequent the classroom. He collects data that makes his methods look good and seems unwilling to adapt the dysfunctional pieces of his course. 

As for the course's content, understand that this course will not teach you physics. It will not even kind-of teach you physics. This is a remedial course for people who didn't do any kind of science in high school. There is no math. The textbook is atrocious, but the primary way you're supposed to learn in the course.The reality is that the one student in your group who took AP physics in high school will save your entire group, and the rest of students will leave the course as clueless as they came. 

And work? Well, that is the one redeeming thing about this course. You cannot fail to get an A. The work is extremely light, and doing it in groups guarantees that you never dip below an acceptable standard. A non-standard (3, 2, 1, where 2 is an A) grading system inflates your grade substantially. As a result, this class is filled with premeds.

If you care about learning physics, dislike group work, or hate premeds, do not take this course. In any other case, this class is harmless but a tremendous waste of money. 

Eric Mazur should not be hailed for his teaching methods. They are a sham.","The positives are: no final or exams, easy to get a good grade
The negatives are: you probably won't learn a lot of physics, group projects can be brutal
If you're the type of person who likes group projects and doesn't get stressed about getting thing done last minute, this is a good class for you. If you are a typical pre-med (like me) you will find this class frustrating.","If you want a good grade and you're willing to put up with a LOT of annoying group work, you should do it. It's worth it if you put in the effort, but it's a huge pain if you go into it thinking it will be easy or that you can do it on your own. You have to really buy in to what the instructors believe to have a good time.",This class will get the requirement out of the way in a relatively fun way but you have to be incredibly driven to learn from the class.,"When it comes down to it, if you are pre-med and have zero physics background, like I do, then you have two choices: PS 2 or AP50a. When narrowed down like this, the answer is pretty simple: AP50a. While the amount of time you will have to commit to this class can be downright daunting at times (~4 hours a week reading, many hours on psets, and group work), the grading system makes it all worth it because you are graded on effort and not accuracy. This takes the pressure WAY off and allows you to sit back and learn something for a change, which is nice. That being said, prepare for some tedious amount of reading and annotations, annoying teammates, and confused TFs. My best piece of advice for this class would be to just keep moving forward and not fall behind on reading annotations, be present during pset and RAAs (the closest thing to an exam in this class), and pray during the Expos that you don't look like an idiot.","This course can be difficult to schedule due to all of the group-based aspects. Regardless, it was such a great, low-stress, and straight-forward way to learn physics!","NO EXAMS NO EXAMS NO EXAMS. If you're like me and hate the usual memorization/regurgitation based learning that goes on in science, this is the class for you. It's far more focused on actual learning and application than useless facts. <3 I LOVE THIS COURSE","very different class structure, but extremely enjoyable, and a greater emphasis on learning"
APPHY 195: Introduction to Solid State Physics
APPHY 217: Applications of Modern Optics
APPHY 225: Introduction to Soft Matter,You learn how much you put in.,"This class lacked cohesion, there was no clear story or goals.  Lectures were a hodgepodge of topics, often unrelated, with no motivation.  Often equations were written on the board without defining several of the key variables.  Other times, basic equations were talked about at length without offering any new physical insights.  More relevant to the course as a whole, expectations for final projects and assignments were NOT clear.  Until the drop deadline, we were told that the final project would be individual.  After the drop deadline, the professors told us we would have to do group final projects.  This made it very difficult to pick a topic that was interesting to everyone.","If you want a broad overview of many topics, then this is a good class to take. However, it doesn't go into depth on any one topic. There was also a huge emphasis on physics and statistical mechanics which isn't applicable to most people's research interests. I wish that more of a conceptual understanding of the topics was given rather than mathematical.","The course gives a good overview of topics in soft materials and points out groups at Harvard working in the field. The topics and homework is well accessible, but the course is not designed to focus on specific subjects.",It is good to take this course if you want to get a general idea of soft matter physics. But not good for learning things in proper details.,"There is good exposure to many topics, but the treatment of any one is not at all comprehensive. A good introduction to physical concepts, but don't expect to get anything terribly practical out of it. The project is a good chance to try something more experimental and was somewhat helpful in solidifying concepts.",Great overview of topics in physics related to soft matter. Good for any SEAS G1 student.
APPHY 274: Computational Modeling of Fluids and Soft Matter
APPHY 282: Solids: Structure and Defects,This class is really wonderful. Frans does an incredible job lecturing and covering a huge amount of material. You will leave having learned a ton about structure/defects but you will also have gained good tools that I think are transferable to almost any research. Just all around good critical thinking skills.,"Although the workload was a bit large, it was the most time-effective course I've taken. So I highly recommend it to anyone who had some previously knowledge of material science and want to learn more :)","Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside the class in order to fully absorb the incredible amount of material covered in this class. A lot of material is covered in a lot of detail in the  undergraduate guide, so definitely use that (especially before doing homework problems). Use the reading lists, especially the books that Frans recommends! I didn't realize until later what a great resource it was. The oral final sounds scary but it can also be a lot of fun -- I think a lot of things really came together not only as I was preparing for my final and also during my final."
APPHY 284: Statistical Thermodynamics,"Very comprehensive, thorough course on statistical mechanics with fantastic connection to experiment and various different systems.","Great class, very practical and with an emphasis on physical intuition it will benefit you in any area of research.  Much, much better than other versions of the course I shopped in the past.","Great self-contained overview of stat mech, especially for experimentalists - with a focus on phase transitions (last third of course) and connection to experimental results (including recent results).  Covers all the fundamentals but not in full mathematical rigor - serious aspring stat mech theorists might prefer a more mathematical course.","The course is difficult and requires a large time-commitmend, but it is very well taught and teaches a lot of background.",I had some experience with the physics version of this course. The material was presented much more clearly by Vinny. I also enjoyed the problems that linked the material to actual experiments and papers.,Prof. Manoharan is a very good lecturer and I would recommend taking this course when he is teaching it.,"Very well taught, Vinny is a great lecturer.",The lectures are great but the problem sets could be confusing.,The course is a great overview and review of statistical mechanics. It can definitely get you excited about the many ways statistical mechanics is applied to different types of problems.,"Of all the physics department courses I've taken, this one had the most applications for people working in experimental physics and applied physics. This course takes a good amount of time. I wouldn't take more than one other time-intensive physics course with it or more than two other less intensive courses, especially if you want to get any research done. This course covers a wide base of material, but covers each part in enough depth for it to be useful. Go to office hours more often than I did."
BE 110: Physiological Systems Analysis,"Go to lecture and afterward, go over the material on your own, learn on your own first then come to class.",The section component and office hours are life-saving. Utilize them.,"This class was pretty awful, although not terribly difficult. This is actually quite a shame, as it is a required course for bioengineering and covers a topic many students would genuinely enjoy if the professor were better. The material was interesting but lectures were tedious and not helpful. The problem sets had little to do with lecture material, and the professor plainly didn't care about the class so it was never clear to either the students or the course staff what we were expected to know. All of the readings were years old so they often didn't relate to what was being taught this year and a few were littered with crucial typos. Although the head TF was very nice, her section was also not very helpful. The two midterms were easy but 35% of the final covered information we were explicitly told in lecture was ""just for context"" and that we were not responsible for. Quite frankly, it seems after nine years the professor is no longer interested in teaching this class and the department should find someone else to teach it.","If your bioengineering you have to take it so that's that. The material is good if you like the stuff, but the class leaves a lot to be desired.","While the material itself is not extremely difficult, the course staff seems to range from disinterested to disorganized, making the overall experience very frustrating.  However, seeing as it's a concentration requirement for the SB in bioengineering, you may have no choice but to take it anyway.","For one, the ""design project"" is not really a design project at all. The assignment is to take a theoretical, arbitrary unstable system and stabilize it with very arbitrary constraints - to many, it seemed like a way for the bioengineering program to satisfy the ABET accreditation's requirement for engineering courses to have ""design projects."" I, along with many, do not feel better equipped to become an engineer in the real-world after going through this project or course.

Secondly, while the course material is interesting, it barely scrapes the surface for useful information - we learn how to stabilize systems simply by using proportional feedback, but there is a wealth of information that is not touched upon (e.g. PID controllers, lead/lag compensators, etc.).

Thirdly, the course is disorganized - the notes used for lecture were outdated and contained mistakes that have not been corrected for several years. The head TF was not helpful at office hours. Review notes by TFs contained mistakes. Support material for exams were missing - for example, three practice exams were supplied for the final, but only one of them, way back from 2007, had solutions.

Unfortunately, this is one of the requirements for BME/bioengineering, and you will have to take it in order to complete the degree. If you want to have a say in your education, you can suggest to SEAS/course staff to make improvements in the aforementioned areas.","BE110 is a necessary challenge for bioengineers -- don't take this otherwise. The class is taught in a fairly non straightforward manner, and it felt as though we superficially learned a lot of the material without any deep intuition of what we were doing.","This course is easier than ES 53, which is not really needed as a prerequisite. You should however has taken linear algebra because the course is all about linear algebra and solving equations. It is mostly a math course, with some physics and even less biology. Overall totally do-able and enjoyable.","Don't take this class unless you're required to. Merfeld is really nice, but he's an awful teacher.","While the material is challenging, if you go to all the lectures, pay attention in class, and read the textbook, you will find that the class is doable. The professor is very good at lecturing and presenting the material in a coherent and clear manner that is easy to follow.","Okay, I'm going to try to make this section as constructive as possible but it might be hard. First off, I'll say that in terms of what you're actually required to know, the class is not difficult. The problem is, a lot of material is thrown at you but almost none of it is taught well so the class seems difficult and daunting before psets/exams because you have to essentially learn everything that you need to know (which isn't actually that bad, if you have good TFs - but that's not the point of a class). The biggest issue I had with the class, was that it felt like ""plug and chug"" with little understanding or actual learning required - and most of the time a question was asked about what something meant the only answer we got was either ""don't worry about it"", or we would get half an explanation followed but ""just trust it"". The course sounds cool and the material would actually be interesting material IF you have to actually learn and learn how/when it is used. To be honest, all the time I spent on this course felt like I was wasting my time because I didn't feel I was getting anything out of it. I think I can honestly say that this is the worst class I've taken at Harvard so far and I really hope it changes in the future, because it does have great potential. Professor Merfeld is a very nice and friendly person but I'm not sure he is the right person to be teaching this course anymore, I think it needs someone who is more excited by the material and wants to challenge their students but provide them with knowledge that will last. In the very least, I think this course should not be a course requirement.","The material covered by this class is awesome, but there aren't many resources for actually figuring out what's going on beyond the surface level.","The material covered in this class is useful, but the way the professor teaches it isn't. You need to have a good teaching staff in order to succeed in this class because the professor doesn't cover the material needed to do well on psets or on tests. Class lectures are also incredibly dull - it's hard to stay awake.","This course may seem intimidating at first, but the assignments and exams are very fair. The course is taught at a higher level than is actually expected of you. The TFs for this course are also a great resource if you feel that you are overwhelmed by the material.","DIFFICULT, but not because it has to be... the material itself is interesting, but the course is taught in a way that overcomplicates concepts and makes it difficult to understand which are important and which are simply details.",This class is a basic systems class with some physiological applications. I think it is well designed for a biomedical engineering student.,Only take it if your concentration requires it.,"You pretty much have to take this class. Bite the bullet and work with your classmates and TF's. Its a bit hectic without real sections, but the teaching staff is always there to help you with the material.","Control theory is interesting, and while Professor Merfeld seems to be very enthusiastic about the subject, I do not think he was very good at relaying the knowledge he knows to his students. After you understand a concept, it actually seems pretty simple, but the class makes the process to understanding the concept incredibly muddled and difficult.","Good class with cool material. If in the beginning you have no idea what's going on, don't worry that's normal. Things start clicking around week 3."
BE 121: Cellular Engineering,Great class that informs you the current state of synthetic biology. Teaches you a lot of practical advice in terms of proposal writing and presenting innovative science.
BE 160: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design,"Prepare yourself for the most Odyssean experience of Harvard. There is no guidance along the way; not even divine intervention could help you. Often times, I wished a car would hit me on my way to class to diffuse the pain this course caused; facing scylla and charybdis would have been an easier task than surviving this course.","Literally the best engineering course I've taken at Harvard. 
Both Needleman and Mooney are great lecturers and AWESOME people in general. 
The material itself is extremely enjoyable. Very applicable, and actually fun to go through. The textbook is almost as good as the lectures, which really set the bar high.
The psets were the right level of challenging, which is uncommon for SEAS.
Overall, do take this course if you have even the slightest interest in chemical engineering. BE160 was literally the highlight of my semester.","There is little I can offer in terms of advice for this class, as this was the first time it was offered and I'm not sure what changes they will implement. This has the potential to be a good course, if more people (20+, as opposed to 5) enrolled and if it was taught with a real section component and office hours."
COMPSCI 50   (SAT/UNS): Introduction to Computer Science I,"If you've never coded before and it doesn't come very naturally to you, this class is hard. It can be a bit demoralizing when you take the quiz because the average result is so low. It's not always clear when you're taking the class sat/unsat whether or not you're on track. Office hours are basically a necessity unless you're a computer genius, but you might be waiting there for an hour or two before you get the help you need.",Be prepared for lots of hours of work but you can do it there is lots of help always available.,"Get into the concepts early on and make use of the plethora of support and extra resources the course provides, it really helps with getting into the work. Do not take this course if you already expect a busy semester (other requirements etc.) because it will consume A LOT of your time.","I would recommend the course, but if you have no experience with CS, be careful taking for a grade because this course is a huge time commitment.","great class, but a ton of work",Do not take this class unless you are interested in concentrating in CS,"Give serious considerations before deciding to take this course ""for fun"" if you have no background in CS. David Malan and most TFs are very willing to help you and are super efficient with answering questions. But if you have no idea how good you possibly are at CS, you might just end spending every weekday at office hours, and may end up completing the problem set, but still feel clueless about what is happening despite attending all the lectures and sections and studying outside of class. Of course this isn't true for everyone, but this certainly happens frequently enough to students with no background.","Unless you're really passionate about computer science or CS50 is required for your studies, do not take this course.",START PSETS EARLY,"This course is a lot of work, but you definitely learn a lot about the foundations of computer science, which I liked.","The learning curve was vertical. Take this class if you love CS and have no other difficult classes. If not, skip it.","Lecture: entertaining, always filmed and posted promptly, notes are also posted and extremely helpful
Section: did not go, far
Exams: they are pretty similar to what are on the practices, but be flexible with your knowledge going in. 
Final Project: only use iOS if you have someone who would be good at implementing in that war on terror.","Class is very difficult, be ready to spend some sleepless nights on the psets.","It's very worth taking, but only if you have the time to work on the problems sets on a predetermined schedule. It's definitely not a class you can put off, especially if you are taking it for a grade. Definitely interesting and gives you a great insight into the programming/CS world.","If you are thinking of taking this class just to familiarize yourself with computer science and to get a taste of programming, you should reconsider. Contrary to the impression given by the course staff, this is NOT a good class for beginners. I came into the course with no background knowledge and quickly became very frustrated. The material covered in lecture does not adequately prepare you to complete the problem sets and exams. I went to office hours every single night and still had to spend 7-12 hours on the problem set each week. It was absolutely ridiculous. The TFs are saints to be as patient as they are, but there are too many students at office hours for everyone to get a decent amount of attention.","The psets take a ton of time. You might think it's a great skill to learn senior fall if you haven't already, and you're probably like, ""Why not?"" But, unless you have a ton of time to devote to the psets, think again. It's likely not worth it.","Prepare for a very hard semester, but at the end you will most likely be happy you took the course.",It is a challenging class,Definitely take it. It is very hard but it is an experience you will not forget.,"Really tough class, but one you should take before you graduate","I came in with no experience thinking this would be useful info to walk away with. I walked out, having attended every lecture and section, still completely unable to code by myself. I don't think I was alone - they basically walk you through exactly what to do in office hours, which is extremely helpful when it's 11pm the night before it's due, but I never really learned how to approach a new problem by myself.","An introduction to programming is often a great addition to one's undergraduate education, but please time this course with an otherwise relaxed semester. (Or take it pass-fail! Realistically, you should probably take it pass-fail.) The teaching is good and the problem sets are engaging and rewarding and leave you feeling accomplished like no chem pset ever could, but this is in part because they are so difficult. Malan is a legend, of course, and the Fair is fun. Brush up on any programming you may know beforehand or watch last year's lectures to get a feel for the material; it'll come in handy.","This is the class to take if you are interested in getting involved in computer science, either in college or in technology related career paths. 10/10 would do again.","While CS50 provides experience with valuable computer science skills and the problem set-based structure of the class allows for ample experimentation with skills, CS50 can, often, feel like more of a show than a class. Lectures can, at times, contain relatively little actual academic content and tend toward videos, clips, and demonstrations that, while fun, are often a waste of time. The course is largely self-taught for those with little computer science experience, and though an alleged 78% of students claim to have no computer science experience when entering into CS50, in my experience that number advertised is at least double what it seems as a member of the course. As a student with no computer science experience, I felt at significant disadvantage to my classmates, many of whom already had experience with the material. To call CS50 an ""intro course"" is to use a misnomer; while some members may take it as their introduction to computer science, many others will already have experience with topics and skills. I don't think you should have to have any background in computer science to take CS50 at Harvard (as it is the introductory course)--but the way the course stands, I think taking the course without a computer science background puts one at a significant disadvantage compared to one's peers in the class.","This class was the never-ending nightmare of Fall semester. The entire week was spent working on the problem sets (yes, it takes that long even if you started the weekend they were released) and every pset required that you teach yourself everything you need to do them. I remember hearing that CS50 was an experience and that you had to take the class before you graduated from Harvard. Well, they were right. It was an experience. Solely an experience. Lectures were cinematic and when it comes to actual learning you better hope you got a decent TF that will help solidify the concepts you brushed over in lecture. That was CS50.","This is not a class. More of a show, or even a cult. But who doesn't love a good cult now and again?",i've taken a lot of classes in my life and this one was definitely unique - really a wonderful experience overall,"It's not worth it. they don't teach you, they give you the material that will teach you. take cs50x in the summer","It's not easy, but you'll learn a lot. I repeat, it's not easy. Don't take it unless you're willing to put in the time every week.","Definitely demanding, but extremely rewarding and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to put in the work to learn a lot. Plenty of resources to use if you are struggling on a pset or need help understanding a certain topic.","The class was definitely valuable experience, and I'm happy to have learned the skills that I did. However, the workload is extremely heavy and many topics are covered very quickly. I would suggest very careful consideration of your workload in other classes as well as other time commitments before taking this class (particularly if you don't have prior programming experience)","This class provides a lot of sparkle but not enough substance. In the beginning they try to rope you into the course by having fun, high-energy lectures. However, as the class progresses it gets exponentially harder. I would not take this class unless you are passionate about computer science and intend to peruse a career in the field.","If you're taking pass/fail, it's important to think about how much you want to spend your week stressing over the problem sets. It was a weekly struggle. While it was a good learning experience, I wish I had taken this earlier like freshmen/sophomore fall. As a senior, it was tough to spent so much time on a pass/fail class.","CS50 is demanding first, and fun second.  Those two ideas are closely intertwined, and part of the joy is in meeting the demands, but those demands do come before the fun and joy.","This class is very well organized and well run.  The lectures are a production, and Professor Malan does a good job of introducing people to the world of computer science.  But that is where the positive side ends.  If you do not have previous experience, I would not recommend taking this course, because you will spend most of your time just trying to complete the problem set without learning much.  There is a lot more I would like to say, but the best description of this class that I have read is an opinion piece in the Crimson titled ""Lots of Sparkle, Not Enough Substance.""  I would recommend reading that article before enrolling.","Don't take it if you want to know how to build something by the end of the semester - sign up for General Assembly or something along those lines if that's your objective (CS50 will teach you fundamentals, but it's not a quick & dirty solution to start coding)",Take advantage of the wide set of resources available.,"If you are interested by the material, but concerned about the work, definitely exercise the SAT/UNSAT option. Also start your psets early and take advantage of section and office hours.","This is a horrible horrible class. It is miserable and they do not teach you enough to complete the problem sets in a reasonable amount of time or even to know what steps you need to take to get them done. It is poorly organized and there really is no body of knowledge that you can master and then apply, instead they just give random coding assignments and do not tell you where to look to figure it out or how to build the skills and knowledge to do it","This class is a cult, but in a good way. I took it as a junior, and while it was very challenging and I went to office hours usually three nights a week, I am so glad that I took it and learned all that I did about Computer Science. Everyone involved in the class has extremely high standards, so be prepared to stay up very late debugging your Problem Set code (and recognize you might have to go to office hours on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights to get the help you need to do so), but that at the end of the day, you will learn a ton of marketable and useful skills in a very short time.","Do not take five classes if you are taking CS50. Also consider taking CS 1 prior to CS50, if you are a beginner and worried about CS50's workload.",Lecture is helpful but less than necessary. Go to section and get through the problem sets and you'll be fine,"You will learn a lot in this course if you choose to invest the time. However, if you, like me, do not have any computer science background, the learning curve will be very steep and the time commitment may be more than for those who have already taken an introductory computer science course. When CS50 is referred to as an introductory course, it should not be seen with the stigma of a course labelled ""introductory."" It is very rigorous.","if unsure, take this class sat/unsat... you will not regret it",The class is very hard and takes up a ton of time.,"Just be ready to collaborate with other students in your class and put a lot of work every week. If you don't start early, you'll end up with a lot of sleepless nights because of this class.","You're going to learn a lot in this course. Go to lecture/watch it, go to section and go to office hours and you'll be fine. Even with no CS background at all, you'll be fine; just don't be afraid to seek out help.","I'm sure you will hear many mixed reviews, but I can tell you that the sum of this class is net positive. It is hard, but it is EXTREMELY rewarding. There is no feeling like it when you finish the problem set and your program runs.",Why are you taking this coarse? The reason I ask is cause if you're like meaning (you don't know anything about computers and want to know more) then you need to figure out your priorities. I took this class as a junior and just wanted to learn SOMETHING. I'm glad I took it even though its bureaucracy is annoying and the class can often feel superficial. Take it pass fail. Don't stress yourself out if you don't get something.,"Do not take this class if you are not trying to fulfill a requirement. It is not worth all of the aggravation that comes from a very poorly managed course with no instructional foundation. I am sorry for those at Yale that now have to endure CS50. people always say they are glad to take it. No, they are only glad they finished it. Not worth going through the semester counting down the days until CS50 is over.","You definitely ""should"" take this class at some point, but make sure to do it when you have time to devote to it, as it will command much more effort than a typical class. If possible, I would also recommend taking it SAT/UNSAT.",Don't take the class unless you have a friend who is a TF who can help you get through the ridiculous Psets. Don't be fooled by weeks 1-3. This article sums it up: http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/12/12/havard-cs50-willy-wonka/,"While viewed as a sort of ""cult class"" for some reason, CS50 doesn't have to be. One of the best parts is that lectures and sections are completely optional as long as you turn in your pset on time. I went to about 2 lectures this semester and still did fine. This class will be easiest if you have a CS background. If you don't, prepare to struggle a bit unless you have a very logical/mathematical brain. Also, remember that you can change to graded (I should have), especially if you do well on Quiz 0. Know that Quiz 1 is very significantly harder than Quiz 0, and expect that. Start your psets early so you don't pull an all-nighter every Wednesday, and good luck!
P.S. Use the final project as an opportunity to do something you enjoy (I did something related to music, my other passion) or learn something new (Python, for me).","An incredibly hard course, but worth it. Take it sophomore or junior year, but not freshman year (too overwhelming) or senior year (you've got too much else going on) and NEVER take this as a 5th class."
COMPSCI 50 (Letter Grade): Introduction to Computer Science I,"If you want to really succeed in this course, you need at the very least a minimal background in CS. Even people who I met who said they had no background... upon further questioning they either had a year of APCS or had dabbled in a bit of programming.",A great class. No background needed.  Start problem sets early and work hard on them so that you wrap your mind around how the code works.  This was my first course in CS and it convinced me to concentrate in CS.,Great course! I only wish i'd taken this before now. (Im a senior),"You will spend a lot of time doing homework for this course, but it is worth it. The class is awesome.","I would tell future students to pay especially close attention to class at the very beginning.  The first week in which the basics are taught are crucial for being able to compound those ideas into large and very complicated problem sets. Also, do not give up if having lots of trouble because most people do.",It is a really interesting class. It is surprising that how much an introductory class can achieve. It truly show the power of computer science in an easy going fashion. I would recommend anyone to take this class!,"It's a painful crash course in coding. You come out learning a lot, but will hate every step of the way.",Worth trying even if you even remotely think you'll be into CS. One of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard (I'm a junior). Takes a good amount of time (dedicate two evenings a week to psets at end).,"Good class as introduction to computer science, but it does take quite a bit work so either look at stuff on EDX beforehand or be ready to spend time on the PSETS.",Take it.,"This is a really amazing course. Computer Science is becoming a more and more important field in this world and CS50 gives you a very general understanding of the potential of computer science and its impact on your life. This class teaches you how to solve problems you may not have thought possible at first. Once finished, it is a very rewarding course.","This class is interesting, but not for everyone. It might as well be a self-taught class with an outside support department. The CS department embraces the philosophy that you as the student should have to teach yourself the subject, which is a little off-putting in an intro class. Therefore, even though you'll get a lot out of this class, the amount of work you put into it may not make it worth it.",Find a partner to work with. The office hours are too disorganized so you'll want someone to do the problem sets with.,"Cs50 is hard but demystifies programming, so take it.",The course is hard and not for everyone. Try to learn some basic programming concepts before taking the course and be prepared to do a lot of learning on your own.,"For me, CS50 was awesome. I had a ton of fun throughout the class, and was always excited to work on problem sets. I learned an enormous amount and feel excited to learn more computer science. There was a great deal of help and assistance during the class, and particularly useful were online shorts and walkthrough videos, as well as office hours. The final project and Hackathon were challenging but awesome experiences. I have to limit all of my comments to my own experience, though, because I know that many people found the class more difficult than I and less fun. For me, it was difficult but doable.","CS50 is definitely a lot of work, but it can be quite rewarding. Very few subjects give you the satisfaction at the end of an assignment that CS50 does. When you finish a problem set, there is a real sense of accomplishment, and a tangible product to support that feeling - seeing images that were deleted and that you restored appear is a great feeling after working at it for hours. CS50 provides a good introduction to computer science and to coding, so if that is what you want out of a course, then I would recommend taking it.","This class lacks traditional support systems so if you have a problem it's a more difficult to get it resolved.  Also, it's pretty easy to not learn the material and still do well on the tests","Be prepared to work hard, go to office hours, it's a great class and teaches you very usefull skills.","If you're willing to put in the necessary work, take this course.  You will learn a ton of applicable things.  However, if you don't make the time for it, the struggle will be real.","CS50 is fun, but does come with commitment. If you like logic puzzles or want to know/understand more about the way computers and technology work and are changing, it's an excellent class. There is a great community built around the shared pain of the psets and final project, largely facilitated by Malan and the course staff. CS50 is hard, and it is a lot of work, so you have to be willing to stay up late working on a single bug in your code, but if you stay on top of things there is no reason you should have to pull any all-nighters. The ""quizzes"" (midterms) are horrible, so study hard, but still be prepared to be unhappy with the results, but overall the class can be really fun and useful.",Great class to take.,"Be prepared to put in a lot of work - but gain a lot as well. Go to office hours, but try and put some thought into the psets before looking for help or going to the walkthroughs.",Go to office hours.,"Take the class! It's a great time, you will have to put in a lot of work but you will come out of this class learning at least something! (which I can't say the same for all courses here at Harvard)","CS50 is a fun experience. The problem sets can be long, but there are many resources available for help and there is definitely a feeling of accomplishment that accompanies the completion of one.",Don't take this course if you want a solid foundation in any specific programming language,"This class will contain many long psets, so make sure you have friends to pset with (or make some with your long hours!).",take the class.,be prepared to do a lot of figuring out things and looking up things on your own,"Do not procrastinate on the psets, and take advantage of all the resources available to you. Office hours are very hit-or-miss in my opinion. Go to them the first few times and see if you find them helpful.","Take this class! I didn't think I was that interested in CS, but now, after taking this class, I want a CS secondary and wish I had taken it earlier.","At times, CS50 made me cheer; at other times, cry. But overall, it made me think, and I'm glad I took it.","For people without prior coding experience, CS50 moves very very fast near the end of the course. While the beginning half, programming in C, does a decent job in hand-holding, the second half, web programming, expects you to learn several languages every week and moves far too quickly for people who have never before seen the material to truly grasp the material. A concept is introduced once and you are then expected to have mastered it. Block out many, many hours a week for problem sets.","If you're taking this class for a concentration/secondary requirement, obviously go for it and good luck. But if you want to take it just for ""the CS50 experience"" don't do it. Even if you're planning on taking in pass/fail you're still going to have to put in the hours and tears so it's honestly not worth the pain. If you take it with friends, it's a lot more bearable because you can all be awake until 5am together. But it really affects every part of your life and you have to plan a lot around office hours and the deadlines. The project, even though overwhelming and terrifying at first, is the most fun part of the whole class if you plan ahead and really try to get going before Thanksgiving. That being said, this was a very rewarding class but as someone who knew nothing about coding, it's a HUGE learning curve and frankly too much to handle with other classes and a life on campus.","It's a hard class, with a heavy workload.","Take this class if you are interested in computer science, but be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort into the course. It is not worth taking pass/fail, as the amount of work you would invest would not be substantially less.","great course, but be prepared for a significant time commitment","CS50 is a great overview of computer science topics and has interesting psets - it doesn't go particularly in depth in any area however, and often spends time trying to be entertaining rather than educational - pretty good class, it's a Harvard experience, but don't just take it because ""everyone"" is taking it.",Take pass/fail if you have no CS background.,"It's a lot of work and really difficult, but very interesting!","It's a great course, but you won't be able to spend much time on your other courses.","If there is one course all Harvard students should experience, CS50 is it. The class is as much of a learning process as it is an experience and performance. From the demonstrations and giveaways in lecture to eating a first, second and third meal at the Hackathon, this class will never bore you. The psets are fun, the staff is enthusiastic, and if you have any interest at all in computer science, I highly recommend it! I came in with minimal experience and will now be doing a computer science secondary!","don't take this class within a hard schedule. If you do, take it pass fail because the amount of work will be very hard to keep up with","Take it if you are seriously considering a concentration or secondary in CS, if not it won't be worth your time.","Be prepared for a unique and fulfilling experience. Also, be prepared to spend 20 hours/week on it.","The lectures were fun to listen to, but they didn't explain the psets very well. It was necessary to do a lot of Googling to figure out what the psets wanted you to do.","Think of this class as an intro to a language.  You'll be expected to put in a lot of hours to gain fluency, more than deep theoretical understandings.","CS50 will be hugely useful to anything you plan to do with your future. Take this class! For problem sets, go to office hours, and you will be fine.","This course is one of those quintessential Harvard classes, especially as it's now the largest course offered by the college. The material is interesting but, speaking as a humanities person, extremely challenging. Be sure to reach out for help when you need and begin psets EARLY: one of the most frustrating parts about computer science is it always takes longer than you'd expect, and you can't rush the process (the logic will fall into place when it wants to). This course is also intensely collaborative - it will force you, if not already comfortable, to work with peers simply because you cannot complete the assignments on your own. The class is high energy and engaging, with lots of cool resources and opportunities.",I definitely love it. You should love it too because I am great.,Great class! Definitely must take for cs and non cs concentrators alike!,"Put a lot of time into it, or you won't take much out of the course.",Definitely take it but it's gonna be hard. So worth it though.,"If you are really into CS and know some coding, you probably wouldn't enjoy this class as much. The class can considered to be very showy and doesn't put too much emphasis on the materials. If you are not thinking too hard about CS, this is a fun class with many activities. If you really want to get into coding, you will most likely look at a lot of activities/ materials as circumvention and distractions. I'd rather recommend visiting some opensources if you want to learn, ex. stanfords or simply just stackoverflow","I really wish this course would focus more on teaching students how to program, instead of making small changes to already large programs. A lot of the course felt like plugging in a few lines into code that we barely understand, especially at the end when an absurd number of languages and technologies are thrown at you without a serious attempt to thoroughly teach any of them.  Could have been so much better.","It will really make you feel confident in your understanding of how computers work. Given how much we interact with computers, this is a very satisfying body of knowledge to know.",Know the mess you are getting yourself in.,It's an engaging introduction to computer science with an excellent support system.  They put a lot of effort into making this course accessible and fun - and it is!,Very time consuming.,"It's meh.  Too much breadth, not enough depth.  Psets are unnecessarily confusing.  But it's a pretty easy course overall.","Do not take this course for a letter grade unless you are willing to make it your sole focus. I took it as a junior, as a fifth class, with no knowledge of programming; the weekly problem sets were too much to truly spend the time they required. The exams were reasonable in terms of time to study, and the final project was also reasonable; the problem sets took upwards of 12 hours. If you are working with a group, it might be manageable (and is definitely recommended!)","Very useful class, but get ready to teach yourself and do a lot of Googling.","The class is like a rock concert at times, but beyond the pizzazz, there is a really really solid introductory CS course.","Despite being a difficult class and ruining every Thursday night, I cannot but fully recommend this class to everyone at Harvard. Although the psets led to some of the most frustrating classroom experiences I've ever had, when I look back at how much I've improved and learned about computer science, it was all worth it. CS is a fundamental part of living in the 21st century, and there's no better introduction than CS-50.","People have mixed feelings about CS50. I personally enjoyed it, but that's partly because I love CS. I didn't find it as difficult as others, but that may be because I've done CS before. If you've taken APCS, it's still probably worth taking - the language (C) is different, and you spend time on other topics such as web development. I feel I've gained a lower-level (not lowest - not quite hardware) understanding on how computers and computer programs work.","CS50 is a must-take! Even for non-CS concentrators out there, this course is extremely fun and will change the way you think. This course promotes peer bonding as you are all struggling to finish the psets. Even after you are done with your pset, you will want to stay there and help other people because it is super fun. If you are completely clueless as to how to do the problem set, the staff is super helpful and will lead you step by step as to how to do the problem set at office hours. Although this is a time-consuming class, hours will go by without you noticing and you will be super satisfied with the end result, especially for the final project. Although the process may be frustrating, it is totally worth it at the end.","This is a BRUTAL introduction if you don't have prior experience. I came into the class with a year of prior C experience, and I still spent many hours every week on problem sets. The earlier problem sets were fun and challenging, especially the hacker editions, and really felt rewarding. Unfortunately, the later web programming assignments were mostly confusing and frustrating and just involved hours of Googling. The lectures are at best funny but usually they're worthless, except that you know anything Malan says is fair game on the exam. The exams are foolish and basically require memorizing past exams and filling your allowed reference sheet with every possible piece of code you could need on the exam because you DO NOT have enough time for the exams. That said, this is the only entry choice for computer science at Harvard. If you're interested in computer science, this is your only choice, so there isn't much to say","For students who have never coded before: I would strongly recommend taking this course, regardless of what your interest are. It teaches basic programming skills and a way of thinking that will help any student.

For students who have done a significant amount of coding before: I would not recommend taking this course, especially if you have completely mastered AP CS or more. CS 61, 121, and 125 are all better options in the fall, or simply wait for CS 51 in the spring. You will probably skip the lectures, and the problem sets are fairly menial yet time-consuming. The hacker editions fall short of actually intriguing advanced students.","Before you take this course, be very very sure you have huge amounts of time to commit to very difficult problem sets.  Do not take this course on a whim or because you think it might be fun.

In addition, as for final project, make sure you and your project partners are on the same page in terms of the progress of the project, and make sure you have realistic, stretching goals along the spectrum. Also make sure you and your groupmates are at roughly the same level, or it will be a pain for both of you.","Definitely take CS50 if you're even considering it a little bit; it is a great experience, an amazing and inclusive community and a great gateway into CS.","The course is difficult, but rewarding. You'll get a great sense of accomplishment for finishing each p-set, and the you will learn A LOT. But be prepared to put in the time and dedication, especially if you don't have a background in CS.","I was really disappointed. The lectures were helpful but I didn't find them comprehensive or adequate preparation on their own -- I always felt I was missing material and it was unclear where to find the material I was missing. It was unclear what, exactly, the expectations were, and I think experiences varied widely across the course. It also often felt like the course's reputation was more important than how much students learned. Make sure you get a good TF and develop enough of a personal relationship that you can reach out to him or her for help on an individual basis, otherwise you spend the semester lost in a sea of 700 students.","Fun but different learning style, not so much for the better.","Having taken the intro CS course through MIT's OCW, I can say a few things make this course unique. First, in my opinion this course is NOT a typical technical introduction to computer science; it is the liberal arts version of computer programming. Before writing it off, I'd say that this has its advantages. Compared to a typical intro CS course, CS50 definitely covers less theory and computational importance. However, the exposure to C, PHP, JavaScript, HTMl/CSS, and SQL is immensely useful for producing finished products that one might actually display, even if the product is not in one of those languages and even if one is not all that comfortable with CS. Except for the first two weeks, this course really throws you into something new on every pset and expects you to just pick it up within a very short time period--a VERY useful skill to have regardless of field. This, I believe is the core of a liberal arts education, and will help many entrepreneurs get started on their way. If you are less comfortable, the support staff is great and will walk you through. Second, the course really exposes you to topics like security risk and the hows behind contemporary technologies that other intro CS courses won't. CS50 is a production anyway, and it's very cool to participate in. Now the downsides. For someone who is more comfortable with programming, this course can be extremely frustrating for two reasons. First, the support staff is terrible for the more comfortable programmers. I guess there's a philosophy of ""hey, you're already here"" rather than ""wow, you're already here. let's see where else we can go"" with regards to more comfortable programmers. The course is also very rigid with regards to implementation. Sometimes I found their distro code's structure very unusual, but I could only touch certain parts of the code, basically forcing a structure onto my part. Debugging must be done with gdb and valgrind (which are tested on) rather than good old print statements. The code must STRICTLY conform to CS50's style manual. For me, this was excruciating as I have been coding for years and do things a certain way for a certain reason. I truly envied my less comfortable peers as their sections were standardized, their pset grades were based on hard rules like correctness rather than style, and their first-time exposure to CS is with all the razzamatazz of David Malan. You're truly stuck if you're more comfortable: this course covers very little theory if you're interested in computer science and does little beyond the basics in you're interested in more advanced programming. However, jumping into CS51 might not be a good idea since you have to fill in your holes to meet CS51 standards beforehand. Such is life.","CS50 is a highly interactive class with an extremely motivated professor and staff who know very well how to make lectures entertaining. The problem sets, office hours, lunches, the Hackathon and the Fair are a lot of fun and it is very easy to make new friends in this class. Students are required to think logically and be creative on their problem sets. It is a lot of fun (and quite easy) to add extra features once the actual task has been accomplished. Although the workload might seem overwhelming at the beginning, I would highly recommend taking this class. Students will learn a lot both academically and for everyday application.","CS50 is a great experience, but you have to be prepared to devote A LOT of time to it. Do not take any other difficult classes at the same time. The problem sets are very difficult and time consuming. Try to get in the habit of starting them on Sunday or Monday, and actually learning the concepts before diving into the pset itself. I got in the bad habit of just trying to get the psets done (by relying on classmates and office hours) without necessarily understanding what I was doing, and as a result I did not get as much out of the course as some of my classmates. If you can devote the time and energy, and also are curious enough to actually learn the material, definitely take CS50. Also, the good news is that if you put in the work (and you kinda have to) you will very likely get a good grade, so that isn't much of a concern.","This class is quite good, teaches you time management, and you WILL be able to code afterwards if you take it seriously.","CS50 is like no other class Harvard offers. Excellent teaching staff, the most resources of any class. Probably the best way to be introduced to computer science, both for people who want to be comp sci concentrators but also for people who are interested in comp sci. Problem sets are difficult and require initiative but are doable, with time. If you are prepared to put the time in this class is extremely rewarding.","I'm not really sure why people take this course. I personally had never had any programming experience before and I loved computer science, which is why I have a positive impression of the class, but it is honestly one of the weirdest classes you will ever take.",Take it only if you're willing to dedicate a lot of time to it,"The lectures are fun and showy, but not incredibly helpful when it comes time to pset. Walkthroughs and office hours will save you most of the time. Psets will be awful all of the time (with the exception of Pset 0), so set aside ample time to work on them. Save your late days for the later psets, because that's when things get really, really, really hard. While it might be a fun class to listen to, and is definitely a fun class if you're not taking it (CS50 Fair and Hackathon come to mind), be careful about the amount of time you are able to commit to it.","This class is great, but it is a lot of work in terms of time commitments.","It's not easy and there are very few TF's that actually understand things well enough to help you effectively (granted that's not their fault -- a lot of CA's and TF's for CS50 are new, which may or may not be the case for future years), but at times I was unable to find help simply because no TF I could find actually understood what was going on either.","This class has a lot of hype, but it's not as cool as it sounds.  I was actually surprised that 800 kids enrolled in a class this difficult.  The class was frustrating, rewarding, and just overall okay.  I definitely learned a lot, but I felt like the exams didn't test the things I learned and instead tested how well I copied and pasted for my cheat sheet.",Very useful but extremely difficult and time consuming.,"If you manage your time well, it isn't bad. Just be ready for some long assignments.","Despite the hours of pain spent figuring out where I was supposed to start, the class made me appreciate computer science more than ever before.",don't take jt if you don't need it.  try to learn on your own if you're interested and highly motivated.,"it's a cool experience, lots of fun, but a good amount of time as well",This course is a great way to get an introduction to computer science.,"The support system is amazing if you take advantage of it. Be prepared to pull many all nighters. It's a great course, but sometimes frustrating because the number of hours required is massive. Watch the lectures at 2x speed. But you will learn, a lot.","Your success in this course will be determined by your determination and self-direction. If you are planning to go the extra mile to learn CS, this course will be a boon to your success. If you expect to have CS taught to you directly, you will both struggle through the course and have little to show for your efforts.",This is a super tough course but well worth it.,Do not take another course with a large workload concurrently with this class.,It's torture but it pays a great deal.,"CS50 may not be easy. It may take a lot of time. It is, though, the most rewarding course you may take at Harvard.","Definitely take this class if you have any interest in learning anything about computers and programming, but make sure you are willing to put in the time commitment.","CS50 truly is a cult, but it's one worth buying into. 

Prepare yourself for the hours you'll have to dedicate to completing the psets (especially if you have no prior coding experience). On that note, it is totally possible to take this course without any late nights. If you start your psets early (~Sunday or Monday), you don't have to stay up late psetting, which leads to a much less stressful experience. That being said, psetting late into the night is also part of the CS50 culture and serves as a bonding experience with your fellow CS50-ers. 

I'm so glad I decided to take CS50, and I feel like I've learned a lot from the experience in terms of actual coding knowledge and self-confidence. At the end of the day, it's a test of diligence and dedication, not raw talent.","Take it. It's good to take. I absolutely loved it. I know a lot of people who didn't, but all I can say is how much fun I had with it. I think it's valuable information, and when it's presented in such a fun way how can you beat it?","You will no doubt struggle, no matter how much background in coding you have. You will discover what kind of a person you are when you are struggling to finish a p-set at 2 am the day it is due. But it's okay! Others are crying alongside with you! This class will teach you how to be resourceful and how to engage in your work under pressure. The best thing that you will get out of this is the many friends and acquaintances that struggled along with you. People do not exaggerate when they say that this class is a cult.","Take it if serious about computer science, problem sets are no joke.","GET READY FOR QUITE A SEMESTER. Great course, lots of time, and cool give-aways. 

Lots of time, so be prepared to work hard.",Don't be discouraged to take it even if you have never taken computer science.,"If I have to hear ""This is CS50"" again...",CS50 is a very good class at teaching the basics of computer science and I found it very enjoyable.,"Don't take it if you're looking for an easy Gen Ed, or if you're not willing to put in 10+ hours a week laboring over problem sets.","It's incredibly difficult if you don't seek out help. Don't be afraid to ask your friends who have already taken it or are taking higher level CS to help you with the concepts because they'll be a lot more helpful than the office hours will be - that's because at the office hours, there aren't enough TFs... You end up waiting at LEAST 20 minutes, sometimes over an hour, to get someone to help you.","I think everybody should take CS 50. CS is a very useful skill to have in any discipline. While you will not come out of the class feeling very comfortable, you will at least have touched upon a variety of different languages that you can then go an learn in depth later. Pluses: Course has a lot of support, networks, resources. Minus: Not as much support for the final project, felt very haphazard, I don't feel comfortable with CS after taking the class.",Very time consuming but very intellectually fulfilling. You will come out here with literally all the foundational skills to learn any language in CS that you want. (Provided you put in the genuine effort),"Take this class! You gain so many helpful skills that will help in all areas of your life.  Workload is a lot, but manageable if you take advantage of office hours and staff/peer support! Fun class.","You get out of this class what you put into it. You have to work HARD, but it pays off. The rewards you get out of taking CS50 are enormous. If you don't think you're interested in computer science, take it anyway, you might be wrong. There is no reason to not take this class. Take it.",Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the course. Office hours is a great tool but try to work on it on your own before you go to office hours because concepts do reappear on the midterm.,"This class is very difficult, but also very rewarding.","This class is difficult. Prepare to work hard. But the environment and experience is an experience in itself, and it gives you some good applicable skills.","It's just really good. Got to work a lot, but few will regret it.","I learned a lot by the end of this class.  That said, it was neither an efficient nor a particularly pleasant way of learning the material.  The course was way understaffed and the new material they attempt to cram in at the end leaves you with an awareness that certain things in web design exist, but almost no practical working knowledge of any language.  It had no coherent framework and lectures were more of a trailer for how cool computer science is than for anything useful in any way.  The demonstrations in lecture are heavy handed and fairly useless.  But you do get free stuff.","CS50 is a worthwhile class to take, albeit a very frustrating one. It is easy to get lost in the sea of 800+ other students, but if you are willing to accept anonymity and less hands-on instruction, you can learn a great deal from the class by doing the independent work that it assigns.","It is not as hard as everyone makes it out to seem. You should definitely take this course, even if you aren't sure you can commit enough time to it.","Take this class, but only if you can put in a decent level of commitment. Only by focusing hard on tho class will you get the most out of it.","An excellent class for beginners to computer science. However, the learning curve can be steep at times and you have to be willing to put in some serious work on problem sets and the final project. Not a class for the lazy.",Don't try to do the p sets by yourself and start them before the night before. Try to get in a section with a TF that you like.,"Although the class gives the striking statistic that only 78% of students have previous CS experience, this number not only seems to be false but also deceptively tricks people into thinking they can take the class without experience. I think that taking this course and learning really difficult, complex concepts requires previous experience. Additionally, although this class does generate a tremendous interest in the field of computer science, I think it does a poor job of explaining how to apply concepts to PSET's. As a result, students tend to spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to figure things out on their own, asking TF's, and attending office hours.",Go to office hours and psets are very doable. Very important subject to know!! Awesome class all around.,Very difficult to manage workload with MBA,"When my concentration advisor told me this class takes up a lot of up, as a senior I didn't think much of it. Having taken the class though, I now understand what he meant. Lectures and sections are basically optional, but the bulk of your time will be spent on the psets. Even if the concepts themselves aren't that difficult, small errors in your code will mean you need to spend quite a bit of time debugging. Also the grading was somewhat arbitrary (it really depends on who your TF is). Having said all that, the class overall was worth taking - you learn a lot of cool things, especially with the final project. I would just recommend taking less work intensive classes with it, especially if you are thesising","Go to office hours and look for walkthroughs, work with friends","If you want to do well in this course, attend lecture and section even though it's not required. You don't necessarily need to take notes, but pay attention because it'll greatly help when understanding some of the more difficult concepts, especially for the midterms.","It is better if you know very basic coding in a language like C or Java, but by no means necessary.  Don't pick a final project idea that is too broad!","A background with CS is a plus, but CS friends and tutors will help even more. The learning curve is steep towards the middle, and especially the middle - don't be afraid to drop down from ""in between"" to ""less comfortable,"" especially since it will help with the grading difficulty. Ultimately, even if you learn quickly during the first few weeks, you might still be troubled during the middle few weeks between pset 4 through 7. Work through them. The network of support will be essential at this time.","If you don't have prior programming experience, carve out time for this class; it will take a lot of time. If you have prior programming experience, you'll be fine.","CS50 is a great class, but is a huge time sink. Try not to take CS50 concurrently with other rigorous pset classes.","CS50 is a very unique experience. Problem sets require a good amount of time to complete, but are usually very satisfying because the final product is something that you can test and enjoy using. Office hours are very helpful and TF's usually provide great suggestions.",CS50 is an amazing class. Everyone should take it.,It is a great class if you are willing to make it your most important class.,"No one should be too intimidated to take CS50, they really do make it accessible for people without experience.",take if if you want to take it,"If you do not have previous computer science experience you will find this course very difficult. The lectures, while explaining the concepts and being engaging, did not help enough with the application of the material. Going to office hours four times a week for three hours a day iis a must in order to complete the problem sets. This is a very stressful class. I would not recommend this class if you have other difficult classes as well, or if computer science is not your passion.",This class is definitely worth the struggles,"Challenging, but extremely useful!",Go to office hours and watch the walkthroughs. Every single one. Otherwise you will spend 10+ hours doing the work they can show you in 30 minutes. Also this class is all about being flashy; the actual content isn't quite up to speed with how it's marketed.,"On the surface it looks like a lot of fun, free stuff, and David Malan.  While this isn't an inherently wrong perception, it's only the tip of the iceberg.  Below the surface you'll see plenty of all nighters, problem sets that can take as much as 12+ hours a week, a very large student-to-TF ratio at office hours, numerous errors and glitches with the CS50 appliance, and overall quite a difficult class.  One bright side is being able to submit your final project and look back at how far you've come (assuming you actually finish your project to a satisfactory level, which luckily most people do).  Then you remember, wait, what's a linked list?","While it is an excellent intro to CS, you will work insanely hard (be proud of your all nighters) and often be completely confused about how to do the work. The psets are hell each week and the workload definitely ramps up after the first few weeks. The transition to web programing is likewise barbaric - you basically get a handful of languages thrown at you in the span of a couple weeks and are told to run with it. That being said, you gain an insane level of comfort with programing and picking up a language is a much less daunting task.","The course material is interesting, but without prior experience in computer science, the material can be very challenging and takes a large amount of time to get used to when coding","Know that you are signing up for an awesome, but that there is a lot of work.  You will learn not only to program, but to solve new problems on your own.  The course is structured so that you are sometimes left to figure something out via Google rather than professor instruction, which can be frustrating, but is ultimately rewarding in the long run.  Your hand will not be held at your job.","I really enjoyed the course. Challenging but I think everyone can get through it with all the support available. The assignments are great. But don't jump in without giving it some serious consideration, it'll be tough!","This class is a solid introduction to computer science. It is easily accessible, and for a while you will not fell in over your head. There are many people who take this class who have no prior experience. However, the main learning medium is the psets. You learn by doing the psets, so they are not easy.",It's a lot of work but definitely worth it in the end!,"Very hard class. You learn more about how computers work and the inner-workings of how computers and web servers operate, rather than learn how to ""code"". But this is definitely needed before you learn to actually code.","Learning computer programming is important, but this class is poorly run, very impersonal and not conducive to enjoying or understanding what you are doing.","This course is a lot of hype and a LOT of material. Despite what the course advertises, some amount of computer science knowledge is necessary to stay afloat in this course. I took the course without any CS background and I was fine for the first few psets, but I really struggled as the course went on and had to rely on a lot of help from those who did know CS -- TFs, freshmen who had coded before, etc. David Malan is brilliant: he is great at computers, and he's also great at marketing the course. But beware: the course expects you to teach yourself multiple languages over the course of the semester. While David goes over certain concepts, you'll have to figure out all the nitty-gritty syntax yourself, or go to office hours for major help. Still, take the course -- you'll always be wondering what the course might have been like if all your friends take it and you don't.",Take this class if you have any interest in CS! Great introductory course!,Take this class if you want a challenge and if you there is any chance you may pursue CS.,"I loved this course.  It taught me so much, and because of this one course, I decided to change my major.

Big time commitment, but definitely worth it!","Great class, a bit too much C","If you're considering computer science at all, whether as a concentration or just a useful thing to know, take CS50. The course is demanding but very much worth it.","Very much worth the struggle of the final project (be sure to start early). The class gives you the beginning skills of computer science with a good academic plan, but gives enough flexibility in the problem sets and final project for one to be creative in their implementations. Beware the time commitment, however.",Very diverse,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. Or, you really enjoy spending hours on end in pure frustration and misery. It will take over your life and you will discover depths of mental and emotional exhaustion that you didn't know were even possible. Prepare to spend 20+ hours a week on this class, if you include time spent on CS50-induced mental breakdowns, otherwise around 14-18 hours/week. For the sake of you sanity and well-being, do yourself a favor: don't buy into the hype, avoid this class like the plague!","CS50 should be required. It's an excellent introduction to a vital skill for our generation. David Malan is a master teacher who manages to make you enjoy the hell out of the challenge and frustration of programming. And at the end, you make something, from nothing, and you realize you've learned quite a lot.","That it is really difficult, but probably worthwhile if you are willing to devote the time to it.","I am a student who had no cs background prior to this course, and I would say that I was slightly uncomfortable with computers. While I learned so much from this course, I think you should only take it for a letter grade after serious thought, especially as a freshman. The course was incredibly rewarding: I went from knowing nothing about programming to teaching myself a language for my final project. However, it also caused me considerable stress, and I felt that there was a disconnect between the fun, lighthearted lectures and the profound difficulties I was having with the material. There seemed to be little relationship between the course material and the quizzes. While this course is a great bonding experience (I made many friends through CS50, and the Hackathon was one of the highlights of the semester), do not take this with a heavy course load. In order to succeed, you need to start psets early in the week and go to office hours on days where it is less crowded like Monday. If you are not proactive about getting help, it is easy to get lost in the crowd of students.","CS50 is a HUGE time suck that is absolutely not worth it. It's hard to do well relative to your classmates because everyone is spending a ton of time and getting a lot of help, and CS50 glosses over too many topics to give you a good understanding of any of them. Skip it if you (a) want to learn computer science, (b) care about your grades, (c) care about your time, or (d) care about your sanity; and I sincerely hope you fall under one of these categories. I came into the class as someone with an above average amount of coding experience and thought that would give me a leg-up, so if you're in that same boat, know that it doesn't really help beyond week 4, and also that beyond week 4 is basically the part of the class that kills you... like actually kills you.",I didn't feel rewarded for my efforts.,"Lots of time, only worth it if you are going to be dealing with software in future","Taking this course is like getting married.

You can do it with no background--don't be scared off and not take the class. Learning to program helps teach you to think logically. It's also useful for all walks of life but especially STEM. Even if you have significant prior experience (I took a badly taught AP class and a summer programming class), you will still learn a lot though the first few weeks will be easy. The culture around the class like CS50 lunch is really fun.","Start the problem sets on the weekend, or Monday night at the latest. And leave your late days until the last five problem sets to use. This is a really great course, and you'll realize how much you've learned by the time the final project rolls around. Recommended.",Be prepared to put in a large amount of hours into working on this and learn how to balance other classes with the immense workload.,"It's cool to learn CS, but this course really sucks in that it basically assumes you have dedicated your semester to CS50 and nothing else.
If you can do that, you'll learn a lot, but if you can't, you just won't learn all that much because you didn't get a chance to let it all sink in.","CS50 is way overrated, to be honest. It's a good course to take to get an cursory understanding of important ideas and skills in CS, but a lot of the pomp and circumstance surrounding it can be kind of off-putting and make it seem more like a franchise/TV performance rather than a class. Take it if you want to learn how to program or figure out if you want to explore CS further, but don't take it just for the sake of taking it, or you will find yourself really not enjoying the class, especially once the second half of the second semester rolls around. Also, be warned that the first three weeks of the semester are misleadingly easy! It gets exponentially harder after that. Go to office hours, take advantage of the number of TFs/CAs at your disposal, and make friends with not only staff but also the students you're taking the class with. They are your greatest resource, more so than the myriad online resources which can often be overwhelming and rather confusing. If you take CS50, really take it. Start early on psets and give yourself enough time to actually puzzle through the problems and come up with solutions yourself, because that is the main way you learn anything in this course. If you don't, you will come out of it feeling like you've only half-learned the skills you wanted to fully grasp.","It's a great way to get introduced to many different languages, but they way they teach the class is not the best.  The class does have a lot of glitter though, and that includes freebies.","If you don't have prior experience with CS you will likely find this class extremely challenging and unnecessarily time-consuming. You will get out of it what you put into it, but it is not an accurate representation of what it means to study CS and is often more ""flash"" than actual content.",just take it. It will be a remarkable experience,"It's a great course that will teach you a lot about how to think in CS, and focuses less on the nitty gritty details of programming.

Many students end up doing 15 hr problem sets over 3 nights. Go to office hours! (also, get to know the staff because they are fun people!)","This is a great course in terms of introduction to CS.  It doesn't go very deep into design and you may not feel capable of producing a full product from scratch because there is a lot of code given to you.  However, take this course to get a nibble of many different aspects of CS.","Although it is advertised as no experience required, you should have some knowledge of computer programming going into CS50. Not necessarily in C or PHP or any of the other languages covered, but you should have a basic idea of how a for-loop works.","CS50 is the type of course where the amount of work you put in determines what you get out of it. There are many resources available to you, and if you take advantage of them you can end up learning a lot about CS. A lot of information is crammed in rather a short time, so you need to review some material outside of class if you really want to master it. Problem sets do get harder later in the semester, so manage your time well.","This course is a good, fast-paced introduction for those with no prior CS experience. If you've done significant programming before it's likely to have less new content for you.

That being said, it is an amazing bonding experience since you are very likely to have ten people in your entryway slaving over psets with you and one of the most fulfilling classes I have ever taken. I came from no background and can proudly say I now know how to code.","I would recommend having some experience in CS before taking this course; it will make you better prepared for when the course ramps up in difficulty. Even so, be cautious not to take this course with other time-consuming courses - your main focus during the weeks will inevitably be the PSETs.",It is an awesome beginner class for Computer Science. The material is really broken down to enable even those with absolutely no experience with code to catch up and understand the basics of programming. Definitely take this class.,"Its a really fun course, but it does have quite a big work load","Although it may seem like a drag or extremely challenging at times, the final project makes it all worth it.","One thing I heard often when I asked former CS50 students about the course was that it wasn't a course so much as a ""phenomenon"" or ""experience."" I found this to be mostly true; the sheer size of the class and the community that formed within it, the highly polished lectures and videos, as well as the difficulty of the assignments all contributed to a course that was, in the end, much more than just a course. Though it may be a significant time commitment, I highly recommend this class to anyone.","The class is very challenging, but very rewarding, and has a ton of practical applications. Students considering CS50 should know that it's quite a time commitment (and should probably consider what the rest of their course load looks like before signing up), but it's absolutely worth the work. Lectures are fantastic and the outside events (ex the Hackathon, CS50 Fair) are a ton of fun.","The class is what you make of it. The more work you put in, the more you'll enjoy and benefit from the class.",Take this course to get a background knowledge in CS and to see if CS is something you are interested in pursing. It would have been good to take this course pass-fail because the exams are just so difficult and the psets are very due able if you start them in time!,"Do not be lured in by all the marketing. I just watched with pity all these humanities kids really struggling and hating their lives having been brainwashed by all the glitz, glamor and subliminal messaging that goes into forming the CS50 student body every year. As for me, I am a pro, so I was fine, but there you go. Another piece of advice though. There really is no reason to ""challenge"" yourself by putting yourself into a harder section; literally the only difference is that they grade you harder.","It's as hard as everyone says, and it's a bit frustrating that they seem to care about the ""brand"" CS50 more than the actual students in the class.",It is more work than you expect.,"CS50 is hard, but incredibly rewarding!",This class brings students into computer science perfectly and develops confident coders from complete beginners.,Take it Pass/Fail,"Tough, but worth it","Good intro CS class, lots of busy work but gives you a broad overview of where you could go in CS","Insanely challenging.Overly ambitious. Be ready to drop everything for this. Despite this, I'm glad I took it, and love what I am empowered to do. But seriously, a KILLER.",GET A GOOD TF.,"Take is sat/unsat so that when the assignments are tedious and not worth the investment, you don't have to waste your time. Other than that, especially if you haven't taken a computer science class before, you learn how to make a lot of cool things. The intellectual depth, however, isn't quite at the same level as a lot of classes since the main difficulty is the syntax of programming rather than the logic.",take it,"Very good course, just be prepared for late nights if you are less comfortable.","Very hard work but rewarding to finish the psets. Go to office hours Monday, get as much done, go again on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday if necessary. Start earlier rather than later. Lectures don't seem very necessary.","CS50 was really a phenomenal course. The amount of funding and effort put into bringing the course together is really incredible. In just one semester, students are able to go from building a simple program in Scratch to developing their own websites and applications. CS50 empowers students to identify problems that interest them and go out and solve them. The course staff are incredibly helpful, and it is evident that all the teaching faculty care about their students' growth. Lectures are also very entertaining to attend. CS50 also opens countless doors at career fairs and events like the Puzzle Hunt, Hackathon, et cetera. That all being said, this course moves at a very fast pace. To get the most out of this course, be prepared to put in a lot of hours. Simply walking through the problem sets line-by-line with a TF isn't the most effective way to truly absorb the material. Challenge yourself as much as possible, push your limits, and perhaps you will end up in the same position as me: incredibly enthusiastic to concentrate in computer science in the coming years.","Start the pset early, ie Sunday if possible. You will thank yourself later. Also, attend office hours. You will get critical feedback.","Ah, the infamous CS50, so you're considering joining the cult?
Here's what I can tell you: 

No, you don't need any cs background. I went in with zero knowledge and did better than my roommate who'd taken AP CS in high school.

The first few psets are easy, maybe 5 hours tops. You can easily knock them out in one sitting with no help. Near the 5th or 6th week though, psets get rather insanely hard. You get used to spending maybe 30 hours on a single pset and still not completing it.

Don't expect to finish all the psets on your own. There is a very big focus on finishing the pset and not on actually learning the materiel so you can literally go to office hours and the TF will literally write out the entire pset on a whiteboard for everyone to copy. This is a lifesaver at midnight the day before its due but you don't actually learn anything. CS50 is so understaffed that you can sit at office hours for a solid hour with your hand up and never get any help. You should really get to know your TF. Go to section, go to their office hours, etc. That is how you will get help most of the times.

Lectures are important but they are also a joke. You really should go/watch because sometimes they go over really important stuff that you need for the pset and other really important stuff for the midterms. That begin said, a lot of it is fluff, where you sit and watch people do silly demos on stage and watch what feels like an elaborately choreographed show. The best compromise I've found is watching the lectures on double speed and fast forwarding at times.

Overall, If you have any interest in CS take the class. But if you are considering it just because it sounds cool, please don't put yourself through this. Make sure you take it as your hardest class and make sure you don't have another pset deadline near on the same day. 

Good Luck!","It's a challenge, but you will learn cs. If you've coded before or are generally very good at math/science things, expect the first 2/3 (how to code in C) to be fairly easy. The last third (web programming) is much harder and faster, so brace for that. Watching lecture videos on fast forward is a good way to cut down the time requirement.",It's definitely challenging but also very rewarding.,"It's not as awesome as people have hyped it up to be. This class is overrated, and you will suffer if you don't prioritize this class to be one of your most rigorous (assuming you don't have a background).","wonderful class, learned a lot, a lot of work","Sometimes, this class felt too driven by weekly problem sets (with many people choosing to skip lecture), which would not be an issue if problem sets did a good job of reinforcing the material. However, especially for later problem sets, the supposed objectives of the problem sets and the actual code we ended up writing did not coincide, forcing students to spend hours on an assignment that might not help much in actually learning more about CS. I enjoyed the final project and felt that I learned a lot from its implementation, especially because I had more time to figure things out. Nonetheless, I would still recommend this class. Don't be fooled by the gimmicks and start the class off right by taking it seriously before things ramp up.",Prepare for the fastest crash course for CS you have seen. Did you take AP CS in high school? That was a putt putt course compared to this thriller of a roller coaster ride. Great for a general introduction into the field of CS. You would be surprised how much you will cover in 1 semester.,"Get started on the PSETs on Saturday when they are put online. This doesn't mean you have to start coding on Saturday, but at the very least watch all the videos or do the recommending reading. You can very well complete the PSET the night before it's due, I've heard of many cases such as these, but it's not fun, healthy, or cool. Doing just a lit bit a day starting on Friday not only helps you get the work done in a more stress-free manner, but it also let's you understand the content better. Also I recommend going to Office Hours on Monday or Tuesday instead of Wednesday. Lastly, don't use your late days until the latter half of the course, because at that point it will be like moving the deadline one day back permanently.","Be prepared to work hard and spend a lot of time feeling frustrated, but in the end taking this class is really worth it.  You learn so much by then end of the class that it's pretty cool to see what you can do with the final project.",Lots of work but great course!,"CS50 is a good class with a lot of resources.  It's great for those very interested in coding/those with prior coding experience, but I can see it being extremely difficult for those who are taking it simply ""to take it"" or as a Gen. Ed. requirement.  As someone familiar with statistical coding, I found some concepts quite challenging and demanding.  As for resources, CS50 has the best of any class on campus.  Malan is a great lecturer (a cult leader, if you will), and the staff is unbelievable at Office Hours. If you're looking for help, there's always someone available. All in all, take this class if you anticipate going into a concentration that requires programming, but I would avoid taking it ""just for fun"" - the workload and concepts are just too demanding.",Difficult but doable. Going to office hours is necessary to get the problem sets done. Take it with a friend.,"Expect to work hard, but to learn a lot.","It is a very great class, but be prepared to spend a lot of time working on the p-sets. Even with a strong programming background, the assignments take time.","This is a very good course to take if you are willing to spend a lot of time to learn all the material and truly understand the concepts as well as do some playing with C Language. Just like you were learning how to use Microsoft Word, computer programming takes time to get used to, because it is very different from other fields. The problem is this course goes very fast and the problem sets are not trivial to complete. I recommend not sitting there stuck for hours on end and go to office hours for help. The walkthroughs are especially helpful.",Only take this course if you have a lot of time and are willing to learn things by yourself rather than actually get thaught the material.,"CS50 does a great job introducing concepts of computer science to people who have not programmed before. CS50 is also a giant social mixer for people somewhat intersted in tech, which is great. However, the lectures contain a lot of elements of show, which I think aren't very helpful in actual learning. This also is NOT a programming course, so your coding skills will need a lot of work after CS50. 

If you have programming experience, you have to consider other options, including MIT.",Problem Sets take a lot of time.,The course is incredible but the workload is really prohibitive if you are taking other time intensive classes.,It is fun,TAKE IT,"For me at least, the class was a massive time sink, which made life very difficult. My impression is that it takes up as much time as you have, which is really rather more time than one single class should take up. Don't take this with 5 classes and/or thesis (given that the plurality of students enrolled are freshmen, it seems like the workload is meant to be more manageable if you're on freshman spring).",extremely valuable skills given the technological state of today's world,"This is not the best way to learn computer science, and you cannot do it unless you have a lighter course load to allow for 20 hour problem sets. That being said, it is a classic experience and everyone should take it at some point.","Take it. It isn't as hard as most people claim. Some psets will be extremely hard. Go to office hours if you get stuck. Believe me, you'll be fine.","Avoid it like the plague.  It's all flash and little substance, one spends more time hearing about how cool CS is than actually learning anput the topic and its uses.","It is an interesting class, but not one that is of great help for your CS education. If you're at least a little bit confident about your CS knowledge/skill, skip this one and go straight for 61.","This class is fun and takes a lot of work. However, you will notice your hard work with your final projects and your knowledge of computer science.","This class is actually a lot of work (especially debugging), no matter how good you think you are beforehand! But it's very fun and you will learn a lot","Prepare to be challenged. Make sure to start the psets early. A lot of people procrastinate and end up pulling consecutive all nighters to finish the psets, which is very stressful. Make sure to email your TF if you have any questions. Always go through the practice quizzes online; they give you a good taste of what the actual quizzes will be like. Last but not least, enjoy the class. It passes by way too quickly, but at the end, you'll have a final project which you're super proud of and surprised that you were able to create!",It's a ton of work (especially if you have no prior coding experience) but it's worth it.,"I would recommend this class, if you have preparation, less so if you do not have any preparation. The statistic that 78% does not have experience is not true, it is 78% of the class self reports that they have no experience. If you are going to take this class without prior preparation be prepared for long nights doing psets. Overall, learned a fair amount, but it wasn't always the most pleasant experience.","Take it. You'll lose countless hours of sleep alongside most of your social life, but it'll still be one of your best experiences at Harvard. The amazing sense of community fostered by CS50 is also unparalleled.",JUST TAKE IT,This course is certainly helpful for one wishes to gain a more deep understanding of important parts of the world around him or her. It allows him or her to explore his or her intellectual passions in a manner that is productive and helpful. It encourages one to use a critical and perceptive view of the ways in which certain aspects of technology function.,"CS50 is an amazing class. It teaches you one of the most important skills in any discipline nowadays - chances are you'll use what this taught you (once you've learned one computer language you can learn any other one pretty easily) at some point in life. It's a ton of fun - office hours, Puzzle Day, the Hackathon, the Fair, the great lectures, the free stuff, etc. It's a party!

I had a lot of experience with web development and a fair bit with Java (which is similar to C), so I found this class pretty easy. If you have experience with computer programming, STILL TAKE THIS CLASS instead of skipping to a higher one - it's an amazing experience, you make lots of friends, you have an easy course, and you get positioned to TF the course, which is an amazing opportunity.

TAKE CS50, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID.","Its challenging but great fun, a must take.","TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you're not a quantitative person, it's useful information to know and there's a ton of support. Thinking through how to write code takes you into a completely different mindset that is unlike any other logical thought process I've encountered in any other subject. You will learn different ways of problem solving and looking at the world and have a ton of fun doing it. The problem sets are set up to demonstrate things you can actually do in real life, like recovering photos you've accidentally deleted. David Malan is wonderful, and lectures are set up in a way that causes you to remember every single thing he teaches you. Highly recommended!","If you're not a SEAS concentrator, take CS50 to learn how programmers think. This is important in immeasurable ways and like math or history, everyone should be at least a little familiar in the modern age.

If you're a SEAS concentrator, take CS50 as one of your easier classes to balance a full workload - it's pretty fun and frustration-free. You can get a lot out of it if you try.","This class was awesome. So many events, resources, and really interesting material. Make sure you don't have too many other time consuming classes, because this class can be a black hole at times.","Take CS50; if you manage your time wisely and don't OVERUSE office hours, you will learn a ton of CS and will ace all the quizzes. It is a heavy workload class and is tough to manage with an otherwise intense schedule, but the material is awesome.","Take it if you want to learn a useful skill reasonably well. The class certainly comes with a lot of hype, and you will pick up a lot of free swag along the way, but in the end it's more or less a series of problem sets.","Perhaps lets start with getting a new teacher.  Past there maybe actually teaching the material.  Next maybe it would be a good idea to make assignments that don't eventually make TFs hand out the correct code because no one (sometimes even them) can figure out.  Last maybe teach a smaller amount of languages so people can actually learn the language rather than learn a new ""trick"" in coding.  That might make an enjoyable course after all of those things!","CS50 was a good experience, and I did learn a lot despite having some coding background (I'd taken AP CS in high school).  Keep in mind, though, that you will have to teach yourself a lot of the course material in order to do the psets (that or get a lot of help from a TF), as lectures are generally not that helpful for the homework and spend more time on showy demos and videos","If you're thinking about taking this class, start learning to code now online wherever, the more experience you have coming into this class, the more you will get out of it and the less miserable you will be later on when trying to do your final project and the later psets. Learn PHP and Javascript/Jquery beforehand because both are covered in like 2 weeks. If you don't have prior experience you may well spend up to 15/20 hours per pset, be prepared to live at office hours and devour the walkthrough code, that is the only way I got through it. Having friends really good at CS makes you get a lot more out of this class. Most TF's get more and more useless as the semester goes on because they understand the material less and less, don't expect much if any help on your final project. The hackathon is a scam, all the TF's are there but most of them are doing their best to do their own work and avoid helping students there","Great course! Very time-consuming, but so worth it. Definitely go to the Hackathon and listen to the walkthroughs at office hours.",CS50 is an experience that every harvard student should have. A lot of work and disjointed at times but definitely worth it.,"This class is really interesting if you want to learn about CS. It is also very time consuming and the problem sets are hard. If it's not necessary for a major, it is probably best to take pass/fail. Taking it is rewarding but you have to work really hard in it.",Teaches you so much and by the end you've acquired incredible programming skills from where you started. It is a lot of work so take advantage of the help and resources and don't get discouraged - everyone is struggling.,Very interesting and engaging.,Be prepared for long nights!,"If you're not going to be a CS major, take this class SAT/UNSAT. It's not worth the stress.",Psets take time and lots of trial-and-error. Programming is fun. Lectures light but still relatively useful. Special events like the Hackathon or Puzzle Day are fun distractions. Lots of decoration for a moderate amount of content.,"It's really, really tough.","This class is definitely time consuming, but is a really great way to gain a broad understanding of computer science and many different programming languages.","If you are coming into this course with programming background, I would strongly suggest not taking this course. You will find the material both boring and overwhelming. As this course teaches basic for loops and search algorithms you won't see anything new, but you'll be frustrated alongside everyone else as you get psets with huge amounts of code in random languages for different applications that few people really understand.","Great introductory class with psets that are not too hard, and re usually pretty fun.","If you really wish to learn CS, this is a great introductory course.  Otherwise, be prepared to spend the semester frustrated and sleep-deprived.  However, you will make many friends through joint suffering.","CS50 is a course everyone should take... Seriously, everyone. Computer Science is useful in basically every field, and CS50 provides an excellent introduction into the field and covers a huge amount of material in only one semester. The p-sets are somewhat challenging, but the real consideration for p-sets is the length of time required rather than the difficulty.",Supplement your problem sets with additional exercises and reading. Really wish I had taken time to engage with the material before launching into each new problem set.,"Computer science is very important to learn, but this will accomplish only part of that goal with a lot of hours spent toiling.",This is a good introduction to computer science. I would suggest taking it even if you don't think you will concentrate in CS.,"Take this class if you have you want to go into computer science and are looking for a gateway course, or if you just want to gain basic programming experience to apply to other areas. Do not take this course if you already have substantial experience in computer science, because the class focuses on showing students the myriad fields CS can be applied to, rather than on foundational CS concepts required for future courses in the department. This course requires a high level of commitment (the only all-nighters I spent this semester were for this course), so don't take it if all you want is to gain a basic understanding of technology.",Take it if you want this class to be your primary class for the semester and in no other circumstance.,boring and terrible,"This problem sets for this course take a significant amount of time and patience if you are unfamiliar with computer science.  The office hours are often understaffed, and it can take a long time to get help.  However, seeking out help from staff and friends is essential to survive in most cases.  I would be prepared for a lot of long nights.",Stay ahead of your work.,I could have learned most of what this class taught me on my own in a shorter amount of time by just searching the web.,"CS50 is a good introduction to computer science, and while it provides an excellent introduction, the more experienced student may want to opt out of this class because CS50 sacrifices depth for breadth, and provides little more than basic knowledge across many topics.","You have to manage your time and not do everything in one night because the chances are that you won't be able to complete the pset. Also, make sure you understand what you are not doing and not just doing it because that will help you a lot for the quizzes.","CS50 is different from most courses at Harvard.  It is presented in a ""show"" format, making everything seem unlike traditional learning.  The problem in that is the actual substance learned.  Lectures do not teach nearly enough information to understand computer science.  Malan uses examples with volunteers to try to make it more fun, but the concepts he tries to explain with the examples are concepts that everyone already understands.  He spends very little time talking about the difficult topics that ultimately come to bite us on the exam or in real programming.   The psets are unreasonably difficult.  First, to get even a general understanding of the material, you need to learn all of that in section rather than lecture.  Then, to actually do the pset, you need to dedicate usually 10+ hours of your time working on the problem set, usually in office hours where you have to beg the TFs to ""teach"" you how to do it.  By ""teach"" I mean you have a vague understanding about what is actually going on but just want to finish the weekly pset.  Students should be able to learn how to confidently code and finish psets without being fed the answers by TFs who want to leave office hours.  Also, the fact that this course isn't divided up into multiple courses is a major problem.  It causes so many students of different levels to be in the same class, which forces the grading to be ""relative to yourself"".  No other class does that because it is illogical.  We are getting the same course credit for the same course, so why should students have to try to game the system in order to get a good grade in the class (by starting off in a ""inexperienced"" section and ""improving"" throughout the course).  There should not be the focus on making CS50 the most popular course at Harvard through those kinds of methods.",Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the psets!,"For all the publicity that CS50 gets, at the end of the day I still feel like I don't have any unit or part of CS that I have fully understood, and the knowledge that I've gained is only minimally applicable to anything I'd ever have to do that involves CS. The course gets way too difficult way too quickly and it keeps students from being able to fully digest material in a way that allows them to make full use of what we're supposed to be learning.",Start psets ahead of time!,"Be prepared to work hard. What you will get from this class is not necessarily tangible; awakening interests is the best thing this class does. It will not make you great at CS, but it will introduce you to the feel.",Very difficult but extremely interesting!,"START THE PSETS EARLY AND MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT CS. I believe that this class is less about CS knowledge and more about perfecting your skills at how to get your question answered, whether that be through TFs or Google/Stack Overflow.",Its really helpful to go in with some coding knowledge. Also be prepared to do a lot of self teaching on the later PSets.,"It's an amazing class, my favorite among all my classes so far (which admittedly doesn't mean much having only taken four so far).","lecture teaches you nothing. the material is worth knowing, and because of that i recommend taking it. but if you're an upperclassmen you won't have time to actually learn the material so make sure you have someone in the class who can teach you. also read the crimson article about this class called too much sparkle too little substance. it's something you should read before taking this class cause its so true.",NA,"Assuming (like me) that you aren't a cs concentrator and you want to learn what computer science is all about, only take this class if you are prepared to dedicate a ton of time.  I did learn a lot and I'm glad I took it, but without a doubt my concentration classes (I'm a junior) suffered a bit.  Maybe CS1 is a good option for learning cs and not taking over your life.  If you do take it, though, start early on psets, and use TFs and cs friends for guidance as much as possible.  They will save you countless late hours.","As a grad student who cross-registered I would encourage others to seriously consider the time commitment required to take the course. I'm happy I took it, but it dominated my schedule for the semester.",take it but make sure u have time,Heavy course load and can be overwhelming at times but definitely interesting and you learn a lot. Be prepared to manage your time appropriately.,"You will learn a lot from this class, but not so much if you are completely new to CS.","I hated this class with every fiber of my being, but I think that had a lot to do with my dislike of the subject matter. I'd still recommend this for students who are passionate about computer science.","If you're worried about the overwhelming cult culture surrounding the course, not to fret - it's easy to shut out by avoiding lecture and events. The problem sets are well worth the time and will give you a great introduction to computer science.","Take it, a little bit of CS knowledge will do you wonders. But don't expect to get much personal attention, this class is too much of a media circus and a gen ed. If you have a little experience in CS, no doubt 50 will teach you something; but I left very disappointed with the culture of the class.","It's an educational course, but it is a massive time sink.","If you have any interest at all in technology, computer science, or simply want to take a challenging but incredibly interesting course, take CS50. I would recommend it very strongly.","This class is very very difficult and time consuming, especially if you come in with little to no CS background. The first half of the course is manageable, but then it kicks up five notches and you start learning a new language a week. Be prepared to invest 15-20 hours a week in the latter half of the course to attending office hours, debugging, and staring blankly at your computer screen hoping it will somehow fix itself (which never happens, unfortunately). The course is very large, but the teaching staff is also quite big and makes a sincere effort to make everyone feel included. CS50 emphasizes introducing you to an array of programming languages, but it doesn't emphasize the learning process as much as it does throwing new information at you and hoping you'll absorb it. Still, it's the best introduction to CS Harvard offers.","Empowering, interesting, and a worthwhile struggle","This may be a class that requires a lot of time, but at the end of the semester, you'll see just how much you've learned over the course of this class.","Great, exciting class as everyone else says. Got me excited about computer science. Excellent materials, but be prepared to dedicate a LOT of time. Problem sets can be hard at time so utilize office hours. Overall great experience.",It's a great class and a great experience.,This class taught a huge amount of programming in a very useful and efficient way.,"Go into this class knowing that it's going to be a lot of work and time out of your schedule. As a beginner to CS, I spent at least 4 hours a night from Monday to Thursday working on psets at office hours because I would not have been able to get through them without the help of TFs and other, more experienced classmates.","It's fun, but tons of busy work.","TAKE IT!!!111 You will learn a lot about coding, regardless of your level. At the end you will both be able to implement low-level features in C as well as webpages in Javascript and PHP. The final project is awesome, and the hackathon is totally worth it!","A lot of work. There are certainly ways to do less (working together, finding the right tf's), but it's still going to be some time. Pretty good course overall.","This course is a lot of work, so only take it if you are willing to put in the time.  But, if you do your efforts will be rewarded - you come out of the class with a 360 understanding of product development and an ability to execute.","CS50 is unique. If you are looking for an exciting class, this is it.","You should not be afraid of CS50. While it is at times confusing and overwhelming, the course sponsors immense, accessible resources that *will* help you succeed. Office hours are held all the time, and most TFs are extremely responsive to questions (either in person or by email). The infrastructure is there; you just have to use it. 

Some of the psets were lacking (i.e. they didn't teach me much and thus felt like useless exercises), but for the most part, I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed doing so. 

Tips:
1) If you're stuck on a pset, go to office hours. They're immensely helpful. 
2) Don't go to lecture. Just watch the lecture online at 1.5x speed.
3) Go to section. If your section isn't good, go to another one (you don't even have to switch; I went to the head TF's section a few times just to get some extra help).
4) Start psets early.
5) Start psets early.
6) Watch the shorts! They may be kind of annoying, but the stuff you learn from them is indispensable. 
7) Pick a good partner for the final project. You don't want to do it alone. Choose someone whom you know is a hard, independent worker. Then do your part.","You've probably heard this before, but this class is not easy. As they like to say in CS50, ""underneath the hood,"" this class is really a lot of work. On some of the more difficult PSETs, be prepared to spend 15+ hours trying to get your code to work. That being said, if you are ever having difficulty, go to office hours! Don't be put off by the sheer number of students at office hours--there are a lot of TF's willing to help! 
The other thing I learned about this course roughly halfway through is that if you take a little more time to really plan out the programs you're writing and being careful while writing them the first time can save you hours of debugging down the road. In my opinion, this course is really about teaching you how to debug your own programs.","PLEASE think twice about taking this class, unless you have NO other commitments this semester and really, really, desperately want to learn computer science. The first few psets are really fun and just challenging enough to hook you, but after that the class escalates and becomes life-dominating. Also, heads up that they play loud, very serious EDM music for the first 5 minutes of most lectures, and actually during most everything (seriously, EDM is apparently the elevator music of CS). And you may want to cry from second hand embarrassment when like 20 people applaud literally everything David Malan does. One bonus: mutual desperation means that you will probably make some good friends who've seen and accepted you after witnessing your 4-AM-in-Mather-dhall worst.","CS50 was a very well designed and wonderful class. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone, even those not interested in a concentration related to computer science.",It's difficult but they give you all the resources to succeed.,"This class is a lot of work. You get one problem set a week and essentially need to work everyday that week to complete it. It is important to know going into this that these are not one night projects.
Lectures are very entertaining and go over the basic concepts but you really need to go to your additional section and get extra help if you want to be able to complete the pset.
The CS50 Fair is actually worth looking forward to, and the final project is the perfect time to pursue something you are interested in.",Find a friend who has programmed before early on in the semester to work on psets with. He/she will be your biggest asset for the class because it seems like office hours are very hard to get help at.,"Ultimately, EVERYONE at Harvard should take CS50. As someone who was very torn about whether or not I was going to take it until the study card deadline, I leave cs50 so happy that I took it. Within a few weeks of the course start, I already felt so empowered with a basic toolkit and understanding of how computer programs work and are made. As much as everyone I had asked suggested the theatrics of the course can be annoying, I surprisingly enjoyed the cult-ish atmosphere. It made it tolerable to sit through  hours working on psets when you were ""all in it together.""","The class, though very challenging, is definitely not boring. There are a lot of resources. I strongly recommend going to office hours. I would not have survived without them. The course will also take up a ton of time, so plan well.","if you are interested in learning about computer science, definitely take the course!","If you're scared, that's all the more reason to take it.",Great course. Take it if you have any interest in computer science and how the technologies we use daily work. Not as much work as everyone says as long as you get a jumpstart on the psets.,"Psets will suck all your time, even if you have CS background. Just takes the living time out of you.","This class sometimes feels more like marketing than an actual class, but the syllabus and content is certainly very useful. Workload is substantial and definitely difficult for a large Gen-Ed course, but you come out of the course with much better algorithmic and logical skills. Final project takes a substantial amount of time but is very rewarding as it gives you the chance to step out of your comfort zone to do things that are actually potentially useful to others and teaches you a lot in the process. Grading is unfortunately rather subjective.",Take it for sure! Amazing class,"Don't be afraid of it, no matter what you hear. No, all nighters are not required weekly (there is a fun whole-class all nighter at the end called the CS50 Hackathan) and there is a huge support structure. If you are struggling, just go to the Office hours, most people find them hugely helpful. Just be disciplined to start the psets over the weekend and get them done on time and you'll be fine and learn a lot.","CS50 isn't the world's hardest class, but you do have to be good at thinking logically and you need to be able to commit a lot of time. The biggest issue isn't the difficulty, it's the time commitment. Definitely learned a lot of useful things, though!","CS50 is definitely a great introduction to computer science but it is indeed a lot of work. The problem sets will take 8-10 hours a week. However, the problem sets are very enjoyable if you are interested in the material.","it's a lot of work. you won't be an expert in computer science just by taking the course -- it really is just an intro course, and so can be a little superficial. But it's a good start.","In the end, I am glad I took this class. The skills and knowledge in taught in this class are pretty important. A lot of time and effort is needed for the problem sets though, and you probably will experience a bit of suffering over them. Be aware that people have varying experiences with this course, with some staying up much later than others working on the sets. TF quality can vary, but you can always listen in on another TF's section. In total, it's a good course, but you may need to make sure you have a smart approach to the class in order to succeed/enjoy it.","For students who want to take this class, I advise that you should be committed to spending at least 15 hours/week on the problem sets.","This course could be entirely self-taught--- however, it is kind of fun to take the class and the events are great.",This is CS50,"CS50 is not a class so much as a social movement. At 800+ students, plus thousands more taking the course online through edX (as well as a soon-to-be a crowd of Yalies), CS50 is a BIG FREAKING DEAL. Everything about CS50, from the office hours to the CS50 Fair, feels epic. Attending lecture is like participating in a gameshow hosted by Professor Malan, who frequently calls for volunteers from the audience and hands out tech-themed prizes like candy. Every episode is available online, and CS50 even has its own merchandise! Some students claim that CS50 is ""lots of sparkle, not enough substance,"" (read the Crimson op-ed if you want to get a sense of the drawbacks of CS50). They're right, but that argument misses the point. Anyone with a laptop and Google can learn to code. CS50 didn't only teach me how to program; it also inspired me to improve my CS skills and apply them to solve real-world problems.","If you are going to take this class, be prepared to spend a lot of time on it. You do learn useful skills (the extent to which you master them varies and depends on how much time you put into the course), and ultimately, this course gives you as much as you put in. Go to office hours, ask your TF for help, and start early! Because of the massive support system, it's easy to go through this class and do the psets without actually really understanding the material, so make sure that if you want to take this class because you want to learn cs that you are willing to put a ton of hours (10-15, sometimes more) into this course.",you need to push to get help,"Don't buy into the marketing, if you have no CS background, you are not going to come out of this class some Zuckerberg 2.0, knowing how to hack together a cool website or app in a night.","This is perhaps the most well structured class at Harvard that provides an amazing introduction to computer science that leaves you with tangible skills in programming, with the ability to figure out new languages by yourself. Make sure to start psets early, and do know that this course takes up a lot of time. It's quite the experience that you should definitely have if you have any interest in learning CS.","TAKE THIS CLASS. I wholly regret not taking it 2 or 3 years ago (I'm a senior this year). I fell in love with the subject and am definitely taking more CS next semester. CS50 is a blast. Definitely go to the hackathon. Definitely go to office hours, and start the psets as early as you can. This class is a blast, and not too stressful if you know how to manage your time well.","It's part of the Harvard undergraduate experience.  It introduces you to the influence of technology and computers to current society. You learn (just by attending hackathons, CS50 lunches, office hours, browsing the website) what's possible in the realm of tech.  CS50 in itself is a massive, full-fledged business of its own-- we realize the power of the merging of tech and business with CS50.","This course is awesome if you want to learn basics of programming fast BUT do not take any other time-intensive course along with CS50. Doing just a problem set for CS50 can take you up to 16 - 20 hours a week so you want to make sure that it is the only difficult class that you take during that semester. Indeed, it gave me a very useful knowledge which allowed me to find my first job in coding, but because I took some other time-consuming Math class, the semester was pretty stressful and sleep deprived.",You just have to take it. You'll learn more practical things in CS50 that you can translate into your own projects and interests than in arguably any.,"During the class, you will feel very overwhelmed with work but, at the end of it all, you will look back and realize how much you have learned and how well prepared you are for future years.  In addition to teaching me computer science skills, the class taught me a new work ethic and way of thinking.","I really enjoyed this class, although it was a huge time commitment for me, in terms of completing the assignments.",Just take it! It's a lot of work but so worth it in the end.,"There is a lot to say about this class, but what's important to you is this. I absolutely regretted taking this not because it was especially difficult or time consuming but because it is so poorly run. Malan is a megalomaniac and is more concerned with cultivating his own cult of personality than with ensuring that his students learn. He has TFs distributing code line for line at office hours rather than actually making psets that are manageable for students to handle on their own, just to make it seem like his class is well designed.","Good introduction class, but like most introductory courses, it probably doesn't apply to what you are most interested in within the subject of computer science.",Great class to take as a freshman and if you want to get exposed to CS,This course is good for the social aspect of being able to say that you suffered through cs50 with your soon to be friends. THere is definitely something to be proud of to say that u survived cs50 but the psets are not easy to do based solely on lecture and will require work,"-It takes a ton of time between Monday - Wednesday -- don't think you have the full week to do all the work, because the problem sets & videos aren't released ahead of time
-This class' content is great if you're starting a multi-year study of computer science. It is a poor use of time if you're looking for a web development crash course or for something that will help you hack together MVPs.","Although this class was very challenging and not organized in the best fashion, it presented a lot of useful information that is the foundation for continuing with computer science, if you are interested in the subject.",It's fun. take it.,"It's harder than one would expect, and not in a good way.","It's hard, but you will learn a lot in a very short amount of time. Expect to do a lot of self-teaching. The final project is fun.","Too much time spent on psets. Way too hard to work through by yourself- if you go to office hours to get help, they will just give you the answers and you won't learn much.
Provides a very comprehensive background for intro CS, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone not looking to code for their concentration or career.",plan to spend a lot of time on this course,"I learned a lot in it, but it was frustrating and took up an unprecedented amount of time.","This class is amazing. It's really demanding time-wise, but it's just SO rewarding when you realize how far you go in a single semester. It's invigorating.",great first exposure- go to office hours!,It is the hardest class you will take at Harvard,"The teaching staff is all very friendly, from the TFs all the way up to David Malan.  Don't be intimidated to reach out for help, as they try to make the class feel much smaller than it is.  Also, if dubstep, late nights, and junk food aren't your thing, like me, you don't have to get wrapped up in the cs50 culture to do well in this course.",its a good class but it is very hard,"CS50 is definitely not as bad as everyone says.  It was really fun and interesting in my opinion, and i had no prior coding experience other than Matlab (aka i understood the concept of a loop).  Most people didn't go to lectures but i did and usually found them worthwhile.  the psets were tough but rewarding because you get a real product out of them.  if you go to office hours and start the psets more than a day before they are due, you'll be golden.  spend an hour or two on them for 2-3 days and you should be good.  i took this at the same time as orgo and it was still manageable. don't be scared off!","The course is incredibly exciting and feels rewarding when you are done. However, the time commitment is extremely high and regular all-nighters are unfortunately a reality.","CS50 is a lot of fun, but try to learn while you have fun, too...","Not well taught, but coding is a useful skill to have",The class teaches you a lot and is a pretty fun community to be a part of as well. But be prepared to spend a lot of time on it. Sometimes it can take 1-2 hours to just watch all the shorts or learn enough about the language you are going to use just so you can start your Pset.,"Definitely take this class. You'll put in several hours to do the problem sets, but you leave with a skill set that you won't acquire with any other class here. CS50 is more of an experience than a class.","This class is really difficult.  You learn a lot more through the p sets than the lectures, so be prepared to be really confused for a while going into the p sets.  But you do learn a lot.","The course was more fluff than content. Yes, it introduces you to the world of Computer Science and gives you a chance to experience the potential applications of knowing how to code. However, very little was actually taught. It seems as if the course was designed more to give people the chance to experience CS than to actually learn it.","The free stuff and production is fun, but this class does not live up to its hype. It's poorly structured, and though you'll learn a lot (I think it was worth taking?), you'll learn only a fraction of what was ""taught.""",Hard class but definitely the most rewarding I have ever taken at Harvard.,You're not a CS major? Take this class! It will broaden your horizon immensely.,It's overhyped but still worth taking - the only way to get a solid foundation in CS at Harvard. Everyone should have to take a foundational CS class like this since coding is becoming almost universal in academia,"Way too big of a class for the current set up to handle, office hours are a complete joke with little to zero help since the student to TF ratio is about 20 to 1, lots of learning on your own which if you're fine with then go for it",Great course overall but definitely time consuming. Had I taken it freshman year I would likely have concentrated in CS,This class is a rewarding experience in which you can make things that you are proud of and also begin to discover how computers actually work. It's fun.,"This is by far the hardest class I've taken at Harvard. The amount of time I put into problem sets single handedly ruined my Mondays through Thursdays every week. I would never recommend taking this as an elective, only take it if you must. Even with pass fail you must complete all the problem sets so it isn't much easier.","The class is what you make of it. If you have time in your schedule to dedicate a lot of time to office hours and working on the problem sets, then you can get a lot out of the class. If you are taking a lot of other difficult classes and don't have enough time to put into the problem sets, you will not learn as much. It is not the kind of class that you can just attend lecture and learn everything.","If you are willing to sacrifice a lot of time to learn about computer science, take this course. Otherwise, you are better off going on Google and learning from there.",It's difficult but a fantastic experience that can teach a huge amount.,Just remember that like a quarter-ish of enrollees either fail or do really bad in this class (and those who manage to get through often just got through it without actually learning things),"Lectures are useless, sections are way more helpful. Don't expect to enjoy the lectures but figuring out the psets is really rewarding","CS 50 isn't a class. It's an experience. Also, time consuming.",It really helps to have some background knowledge of C and/or some other languages.,"This is a great course to get your feet wet in computer science. Even if you don't plan on concentrating in computer science, I highly recommend taking CS50 for the experience if you have the time to commit.","Lot of work, lot of fun.",It's difficult but pays off.,"You may very well come to hate yourself from taking this class while you're in the middle of it, but looking back on it you'll actually be glad you took it. That sounds ridiculous and unlikely, but reading comments exactly like this one made me question whether that was possible and it very much is. It can be a lot to handle while you're doing it, but if you do decide to go for it, you'll actually miss it in the end.","It is a lot of work, but it is so incredibly rewarding in the end. It is one of those courses where you get out of it what you put into it. If you put in the work, you will be incredibly rewarded in the end.",Take at least one easy course to accompany this one if you want to make it manageable,great production value.,"It's a lot of fun, but a lot of work. Make sure you start the problem sets early, because it can be hard to get help later in the week when there are hundreds of people at office hours.","Take this! The psets each week feel equally difficult, even though the psets get much more complex as the weeks go on. By the end of the hackathon you will be amazed by how far you have come.",Learn a lot but it's also a lot of work
COMPSCI 61: Systems Programming and Machine Organization,"I think 61 is a great class, but don't take it unless you have sufficient time/energy to devote to it. Learning the material last minute is particularly difficult, and trying to finish problem sets last minute or do well on the (very difficult but curved) exams without really knowing what's going on can be demoralizing","Don't take this as a senior; take it earlier in your career. Simply because you might feel frustrated taking a large, intro course your senior fall.","Take this class, take this class, take this class, TAKE THIS CLASS.  If you are remotely thinking about doing anything CS at all, TAKE THIS CLASS.  Even if you aren't sure you want to do CS, TAKE THIS CLASS.  This class is amazing.  Eddie is amazing.  I would put a 6 as a rec if I could.",Fantastic class. Professor is super energetic and helpful. Psets are fun and you'll learn a ton. This course taught me so much about the low level aspects of computers.,Make sure you have lots of free time to put in working on the psets.,"It's the best class I've taken so far at Harvard! Eddie is an amazing teacher, and the coursework is super interesting.","If your CS50 is your only computer science experience, make sure you have enough time to dedicate to this course for the semester. The course material is very interesting; having the time to understand it fully makes it even more rewarding and less stressful.","I LOVED this class. I was feeling really burnt out and kind of lost within CS but this class showed me why I chose this concentration in the first place. The tests seem basically IMPOSSIBLE but they test something that every real programmer should have: resourcefulness. If you are smart about your time and know what information will help you, you'll do just fine. The problem sets are super awesome and while difficult, are not impossible. By the end, you'll feel incredibly satisfied and be a C master. I cannot recommend this class enough. The teaching staff is incredible and Eddie is a god. He cares so much about his students and is willing to break things down like you're five (which I definitely needed at points). TAKE THIS CLASS!",Worth it,"This class is AMAZING!!! It will take over your life in every way and you will become a slave to it. . .  but you will fall in love with CS and it is completely worth it. Eddie Kohler is an INCREDIBLE teacher -- get to know him if you take this course. He is absolutely hilarious and wonderful and truly a genius. Also, choose a pset partner who you want to become best friends with -- you will be spending a huge amount of time with them and will probably want to kill them otherwise. But seriously, this class is the best thing to happen to CS at Harvard TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.","If you want to dive in to the nitty grity of a computer, I would totally take this course! However, if you are looking at Computer Science from a higher perspective, I'm not sure if this is the most useful thing to take. Make sure that you recognize the importance of a good partner early on. Think about who you would want to partner with on the first pset and reach out to them early.","This is a very difficult class. But you will learn a lot. It is very worthwhile, and at the end of the day, you will be a much better programmer.","Eddie is the best lecturer I've had so far at Harvard. This class is a lot of work, but it's really rewarding. Make sure you find a partner early on (when you're allowed to have partners on the psets), and make sure you have enough time in your schedule to really invest in this class. It's so worthwhile but only if you put in the (extensive) time and effort needed to do well in this class, something I learned too late in the semester.",The class is phenomenal and Kohler is one of the best professors you'll meet. The material is difficult but rewarding and the class is totally survivable.,Well worth the struggle to understand how your computer works on a deeper level.,"Really good introduction to systems programming. A lot of the experience has to do with your partner so choose well. Some of the problem sets take more time than others, be careful! Tests are very tricky, would take good notes and familiarize yourself with the source code.","This is a rather challenging but very rewarding course. You will see everything under the hood of the magic box. The reasons for apparently strange things like pointers and the sizes of integers will be made clear to you. And then you will be introduced to newer and stranger concepts that will significantly increase your appreciation of the work that has gone into making the modern computing environment, as well as understanding a bit more about what can go wrong~ (1337 h4xx0r5!)",TAKE IT!,This is not CS 50. It's better though.,"It takes some work, but it's an engaging course and I learned a lot.","I have now taken CS 50, 51, 121, and 61 in the CS department, and CS 61 was (by far) the hardest of those courses. At the same time, the level of depth in this course is unparalleled among CS classes I've taken. CS 61 delves very deep into a lot of important issues (file I/O, kernel programming, assembly, etc.) and empowers students to write very powerful code. (For instance, by the end of this course, you can program file I/O systems that can beat stdio in most cases; implement the ability to create new processes in a simple operating system; and write a simple garbage collector that eliminates much of the inconvenience of having to free memory in C.) After this course, you will feel like an excellent programmer. Eddie is also an excellent instructor; he is funny and engaging, and he is clearly very enthusiastic about the subject matter and about teaching.

This class is not easy by any means (at least not for me). I spent less time on it than I should have, and ended up doing poorly on many psets as a result. But if you are willing to put in a lot of work and don't have a terribly hard course schedule, you can probably manage it well. All in all, if you are willing to work hard, you will learn a TON from this class and come out of it feeling like you have accomplished truly remarkable things. Take this class!!!","It's challenging, but very rewarding and good to experience Eddie!","Take it! Definitely worth it to round out the 50/51 series. Eddie is also an amazing lecturer, so if you typically find yourself falling asleep in other cs courses, take this one, because that won't happen!","Eddie's enthusiasm is contagious! He really made me appreciate the nuts and bolts of what goes on in a computer when it runs programs, and I think this knowledge is essential for a computer science education. You really only need to have taken CS50 to take CS61, but for me having extra programming experience definitely helped. The problem sets are difficult at times, and they're definitely time-consuming, but I found some to be quite fun. The course was pretty organized this year, but the midterm & final are still hard- but it's hard for every student basically. Definitely take this class at some point in your undergrad time if you're a CS major!","It was a hard, but rewarding class. Problem sets take forever, but you learn a lot and it's always interesting and fun working on them, so you don't notice the hours as much. Lectures are engaging. And the material is really cool.",IT'S REALLY HARD.,"It is a very challenging course, though you learn a LOT and Eddie is a wonderful lecturer. Despite the fact that the course kicked my butt, it was a great experience and I have grown tremendously as a problem solver. Not for the faint of heart, but definitely consider this class if you are interested in the inner workings of your computer!","This is a very good class, and I definitely recommend you take it. Eddie Kohler is very funny and engaging, the pests are interesting and fun, and the material is really cool.",This class is a great intro to learning how a computer actually works! You learn to appreciate how fascinating and complex the machine you're staring at right now actually is.,Take it 80% for the material and 100% for Eddie Kohler. 180% is also indicative of how much time and effort you should expect to put into the psets.,"Find a pset partner early. This class really requires you to work collaboratively with that partner, so be familiar with git basics. The psets are super time-consuming but totally worth your effort, plus you get to say that you coded up a primitive shell, or dynamic memory allocator, or teensy weensy operating system, which is always cool. I would brush up on C programming skills before heading into this class if you're not feeling completely comfortable, or at least be super comfortable with the level of C taught in CS50. Be open-minded - some of the systems programming concepts might appear foreign to you as it did to me but Prof Kohler is so clear and vivid with his explanations that it makes the material fun to learn and easy to pick up.","Take this at your own risk! It is difficult and will require a lot of time, but if you get through it, it is the most rewarding feeling.","This is an incredible course!  Prof. Kohler is a great, engaging professor and you'll leave the course with a really solid footing in systems programming.  The material is also essential for any one who wants to code seriously, even those who are only interested in higher-level stuff.","CS61 with Professor Kohler is a fantastic class.  Although the first few lectures are a bit slow because students come in with so many different background levels, they're still worth attending because the professor is engaging, funny, and really good at explaining concepts in simple, memorable ways (and at staging hilarious demos!).  The impression I got throughout the semester is that Professor Kohler is just genuinely incredibly excited about anything systems programming-related, and his excitement is infectious.

The problem sets are challenging and definitely needed to be started early, but they're also extremely interesting and are structured in such a way that you feel an incredible sense of accomplishment after completing each one - you defused a (binary) bomb!  You built an entire OS!  I also appreciated how skillfully the logistics were handled - I never felt that we were being given an unfair amount of work or that I wasn't receiving timely feedback.

Lastly, you won't need to read the textbook if you attend lectures, but CS:APP2e is really good as far as textbooks go - clear and comprehensive without ever being simplistic.","This is a great class, and it really goes in depth about CS at the low-level. Eddie's such an amazing lecturer, and the psets are hard but worth it! Take the class!!!","If Eddie is teaching it, definitely taking it. Otherwise it depends on whether or not you liked the low-level part of cs50","This class was a highlight to my first semester.  The concepts are challenging at times and some of the psets, especially the first couple can be daunting, but you learn a ton and Eddie is really enthusiastic and inspiring.","Kohler is a great lecturer, the material he teaches is really interesting, and every problem set presents a new and interesting range of problems in a fun way.","This was an excellent course in every way. I learned a lot, I became both more skilled with systems and learned about how to code well. The course staff was excellent, and Eddie is an awesome professor. He shows awesome enthusiasm, and this class revived my faith in live-coding during lectures.","This class was difficult but ultimately rewarding. I learned so much; Eddie is a great lecturer and managed to pack a lot of content into each hour and a half. The problem sets were difficult, and some were quite time-intensive, but I truly feel like I became a much better programmer because of this course. That said, I wasn't particularly interested in the content going in and figured it would grow on me. I think my lack of genuine interest made me a little more reluctant to devote as much time to the class as it undoubtedly deserved.","CS61 was really hard. The psets were difficult and the midterm/final were possibly some of the hardest exams I've taken at Harvard. You definitely learn a lot though!

Looking back, I shouldn't have taken the class (did not have enough interest in the material), but I know a lot of other people who loved the class!","You should really only take this course if you are legitimately interested in systems programming. I am not, and took this class anyway because I love math and programming, and I ended up not enjoying it very much.","This class is fantastic, but a LOT of work. Eddie is by far the best professor I have ever had, and he is so patient with everyone. The material is really interesting, but it is very difficult. I am not a CS concentrator, and having only taken 50 and 51, I really struggled with a lot of this stuff. I know that some people were much better prepared than I was, but I accepted this large disparity in knowledge. You will learn so much cool stuff about how computers work, and the high to low level connections are so rewarding to understand. My one regret is that I simply didn't have enough time to dedicate to this class. If you take this class, make sure you have room in your schedule to work about 20 hours a week on the material.","CS61 feels like the first real computer science class I've taken at Harvard. It's a lot of work, and the exams are brutal, but I'm a far, far better programmer than I was when the class began. You'll learn things about computers that you've always taken for granted, which is an awesome feeling. Take it and enjoy it; Eddie is a fantastic professor and you'll be in good company with him.","CS61 teaches you what really goes on in your computer, and covers a lot of ground -- OS, shell, networks/concurrency, bitwise ops, assembly, etc. It's hard, but definitely doable and the psets are a lot of fun!  Exams are ridiculously hard, but even if you fail them, you come out of this class having learned a ton, which was one of the greatest feelings ever.","While at times the material was not what I can see myself digging even further into of my own interest, the course is so well taught under Professor Kohler that it is very much worth it.","Eddie is a fantastic teacher that knows how to walk the fine line between challenging his students to take learning into their own hands and giving his students enough guidance and resources to make as much progress as quickly as possible. It will likely take a long time outside of class to fully understand the material unless you already have a solid understanding of C programming and systems fundamentals. That said, it is very rewarding to dig deeply into the material and understand what is really going on at the heart of many things you use every day. And if you grasp the material more quickly than others, there is no shortage to how you can extend concepts and further challenge yourself on psets with extra credit opportunities.","Definitely take this class! Eddie is the best professor I've had so far at Harvard - his lectures are really interesting and applicable, and he's just a hilarious and great guy in general. It definitely takes a lot of work but you learn a lot doing them, and get to see the way a bunch of systems that we take for granted actually work. It's a great way to see if you like backend/systems type work, and even if you end up not liking that type of CS, it's super relevant information.","Amazing class. You'd be a fool to concentrate in CS and not take it -- challenging in all the right ways, Kohler's the man. Teaching staff is phenomenal.","For those of you remotely interested in the material, the course is excellent and you can take it pass/fail. Its a hard course nonetheless but the material is awesome. Makes you a better programmer. Seriously, the course is tough but there are so many cool things about the material and Eddie is awesome.","Eddie Kohler is one of, if not the best, CS professors at Harvard. He has a way of explaining concepts that is hilarious, memorable, and intuitive. Systems is actually not one of my favorite areas of CS, but since Prof Kohler was teaching it, I would rank this class as one of my favorites here. Now if only I had actually gone to lecture in person instead of cramming the videos in before the psets...","This class is a MUST-TAKE if you're anywhere near the CS department. For concentrators, worth making space in your sophomore fall rather than waiting. Try to do this and 121 together.","This is quite possibly one of the best CS courses I've taken at Harvard.  NOTE: It is significantly harder than 50 and 61, but Eddie and the Staff help you to adjust to the difficulty.  Be prepared to spend a decent amount of time on the psets and make sure you have a good partner (don't just pick a good friend, pick someone who is good to work with).  The exams are tough, and I don't think you can guarantee you'll get an A, but the material itself is fascinating and Eddie is simply AMAZING.","This class is both very useful and very painful. In retrospect glad I took it, and I'm excited about the concepts we learned. I do feel like it's not really my ""thing,"" and it might not be yours, either. The course is well-organized and Eddie Kohler is fantastic, but it's still very possible to get absolutely lost.","This class is awesome. Eddie is great and a super engaging lecturer. If you liked the C component of CS50, you'll love CS61.","Take it if Eddie is teaching it! He's A++. He's hilarious (check out his Twitter) and genuinely cares about the topic/making sure students know the material. It's slightly intimidating talking to him, but after your conversation with him, I guarantee you will understand the material much better. This is a class where the professor cares that you're learning the material and not memorizing it.","This is a great class that does teach you a lot about systems. Eddie is a fantastic instructor who, as a systems expert, is great at presenting code-based lectures. However, run-of-the-mill CS students will have a really tough time in this class. A lot of people take this class as a requirement, but many take it because it's a fun side class for them, and so while less experienced students (i.e. those who took CS50 and 51 and had no prior experience) are struggling through assignments, other people treat the psets as fun little brain-teasers that don't take too much effort. You can go to all the office hours you want without feeling like you're actually making progress in the course. Options for help in this course are very limited, and if you can't figure out a certain part of a pset, there's a big chance you'll get stuck and won't be able to finish it. You can still get something out of the class, but the experience will be pretty difficult.","To put things in perspective, I only took CS50 prior to this course. The course is hard in the sense that you see quite a bit of new systems-level concepts and you have to apply them. There is a very good support structure for getting you started. Most of my issues stemmed from poor assumptions on my part about how something works - the actual programming of problem sets is not that difficult as the lectures, sections, and problem set spec do a great job of guiding you along the way. You can do the problem sets with a partner which makes things easier. I worked alone (keep in mind, I'm no experienced programmer) and still found the work load to be very manageable if you stay on top of things and do not procrastinate everything until the last minute.","This is an awesome class and you will learn a lot, but make sure you enjoy programming and are willing to work hard, otherwise you will probably be unhappy with the amount of work required to do well.","Eddie is one of the best teachers I've had at Harvard. His lectures are relevant and engaging, and he puts a huge amount of personal energy into helping students. Not all professors are as engaged with the students and material of a class as he is. He really cares, and as a result even when the material was difficult I never really felt overwhelmed. The problem sets are also really well structured.","The class becomes much easier if you do it with a partner, though you may not learn as much.","Easily the best class I've taken at harvard so far. Eddie makes this class fun but tough. He listens to the students to make sure if it is getting too ridiculous, to give you a few hints to help you along your way. I looked forward to every single lecture and assignment. This class is not easy, but totally worth it.","This is the most difficult CS class I've taken. In fact, the most difficult class I've taken ever (just finished Sophomore fall). That being said, I highly, highly recommend this class. You learn a lot about how a computer system works as you learn programming on a lower abstraction level. You definitely come out of the class as a stronger programmer.","Take this course! It is so much better than the two intro courses - you feel like you're learning all the time, lectures are incredibly engaging, and Eddie is a skillful teacher. Finishing the problem sets is rewarding when you look at what you built, especially since it's no longer just ""fill in the blanks"" and you have to do some design alongside the coding.","This class is a good follow-up to CS50. It's harder, but not unreasonable. A good partner is very helpful for the assignments. Exams are difficult, but then the staff hands out partial credit like it's candy.","While I think the subject matter of this course is very important, and Eddie is a great professor who really cares about his students, I don't think I got as much out of this course as I usually do in CS classes, especially given the amount of time I put into it.","This will be one of the harder classes in your schedule, if not the hardest. You have two weeks per problem set, but those two weeks are given for a reason. You'll find yourself struggling a lot if you procrastinate.","Lectures are well-planned, clear, and engaging. The problem sets are really well-designed, and working through them is a fun, challenging, and rewarding experience. Professor Kohler is also one of the best professors I've had at Harvard!",This was a fun course. Especially the assembly assignment.,"This is a butt-kicking course. The systems knowledge covered is absolutely fundamental to any computer scientist, and you'll learn how seemingly small changes to your code can make it much more efficient. But the process in getting there is also butt-kicking, and there's a lot more struggling involved than one might originally anticipate. Overall, you'll work a lot to learn a lot.","Make sure you don't fall behind on the material! Ask questions until you fully understand everything. If you don't, the exams will be the death of you in this course, since they have an ability to weed out those details in the course material that you thought were irrelevant in the larger scope of things. It is possible to complete the psets understanding the function of and general ideas of some concepts without fully understanding the mechanisms that make them work, which again, will be tested in the exams.","This class's main focus is to make you a better programmer.  You learn a bit about the way low-level parts of computers work along the way, but you'll overall spend a lot of your time figuring out how to handle complex coding projects.  It also makes you a lot better at debugging.  Professor Kohler is an amazing person; you should take the class just so you can experience his teaching and get to know him.","This is a great introduction to systems programming. Professor Kohler is hilarious, and I definitely feel that I know a lot more about C and how computers actually work than I did before. Being able to even think about the systems level was very useful for interviews that I was doing this fall.

It's a fairly different perspective on programming in terms of how to manage resources and get code to run faster and how the computer actually interprets what you're telling it to do  -- I highly recommend it for anyone who's interested in working in CS long term.","Thank you, Eddie, for restoring my faith in CS. So glad I took this course–you learn super cool material that feels very much applicable to the ""real world"" situations, and being taught by the amazingly hilarious, engaging, and devoted professor like Eddie certainly didn't hurt.","It's really great to take a CS class on levels of programming you take for granted. I love CS classes that are less ""learn to program good for a job"" and more like a humanities class, in the sense that you study ""why things are the way they are"". I learned a huge amount and Eddie is amazingly funny and nice and smart. Obviously, its a lot of work but that shouldn't bother a CS concentrator, YOU CHOSE THIS LIFESTYLE.","TAKE IT!! If I end up working in some sort of programming job, it will be because I took this class.","Eddie Kohler is a fantastic professor. He brings so much energy and enthusiasm to the classroom and the subject matter, it's infectious. The problem sets for this class are great (but of course quite time-consuming). Just be aware that the exams are notoriously difficult and even with a lot of preparation can be pretty rough. Still, I absolutely loved this class. It will make you a better programmer, and you'll really learn C.",A hard but essential class.  Eddie is the best!,"I didn't know C at all upon entering this class, and I have gotten by so far. The first 3 psets are ok, but the next 3 are rough. Midterm average was around a 70.",This is a great class but requires a lot of work.  The problem sets are tricky but rewarding.,"Actually a fascinating topic. The psets are challenging but extremely rewarding, and it's a great warmup if you plan to eventually take 161. Lecture is good but only helpful if you already have a basic understanding of the material. Otherwise Eddie's examples may go over your head. Go to section, and the section notes and examples are really helpful for getting the major concepts. Overall, highly recommended!","This is the best class you will ever take at Harvard. If you are serious about computer science, you have to take this class. Learning systems programming will make you a better computer scientist in every way--no matter your specialty. If you aren't a computer scientist, you should still take this class because it teaches you a way of thinking that is useful for every field. Kohler is a fantastic professor as well!"
COMPSCI 105: Privacy and Technology,TAKE THIS CLASS,Everyone needs to take one class with Prof. Waldo before graduating.,"It is a great class to learn on a high-level about policy and technological issues regarding privacy.  It is super manageable in terms of work -- a paper assigned every Thursday and due every Sunday that alternates between being individual and group-written. It is great for people of all backgrounds -- people of technology backgrounds are likely to learn about the policy side and vice versa. It's also a great way to meet people, and the final projects are a super fun time where you can explore topics in depth or create a cool program. Just try for the lottery -- if you show interest and creativity, there's a high chance you'll get in! (And an even higher chance you'll get in the next year!)",Take this class!  One of the best I have taken at Harvard.  The TFs are great and Professor Waldo is a rare kind of professor at Harvard: he really cares about his students and takes the time to get to know them.,"This class is absolutely incredible -- you get to talk about privacy issues with an amazing group of driven, smart people. Also, Jim Waldo and Latanya Sweeney are such interesting, sociable, fun people, and I feel like I grew as a person while taking this class. Recommend with enthusiasm x 100.","This is really a gem of a course. The peers who you talk with and who clearly all have something to say about privacy issues are incredibly diverse in the backgrounds they come from, which I think is one of the strongest facets of this course. Waldo and Sweeney are among the brightest minds in this field, and are incredible just to hear, let alone interact and speak with (to which they are surprisingly accessible). Super great course -- if you get in, do it. If you're not sure about applying, apply.","This is an amazing class! You will get as much out of it as you put in. There are a some readings for every class but not as much towards the end of the class. The final project is open ended and a great way to investigate something you are passionate about. Prof Waldo has a lot of resources and really makes an effort to make the material accessible, interesting, and hands-on.",This was the best course I have taken at Harvard. It is one of those courses that every student should have to take as it opens our eyes to so many pertinent issues of today.,"This was an excellent course overall; if you're a CS secondary who is less comfortable with some of the more technical courses, and you can get into CS105, then take it. Workload is extremely minimal, Waldo is a fantastic professor, and discussions are genuinely engaging.","When I took this class, I was a senior majoring in Social Studies looking to complete her Culture and Belief requirement with a well-reviewed class. Though I came from a non-tech background and was in my last year of college, this course was one of the best experiences of my time at Harvard and continuously impacted my perspective. I just had so much FUN in class. Prof. Waldo and the other students selected for the class never ceased to be engaging. The assignments were thought-provoking and interesting to write. I am now considering ways in which I can incorporate my newfound understanding of privacy and technology in the long-term.","Even though the application might seem daunting, just do it. It's a great course with a reasonable courseload that covers a lot of interesting materials. It's also not very technical in nature.",This class is great and teaches you so much on how to shape a world view in today's technology age.,"This class gets very hyped up, but it's honestly a bit of a let down. The wide range of skills in the class means that you can't really touch on any topic with depth. In the end it was actually very boring.",CS 105 is a great class. Jim Waldo is extremely enthusiastic about the class and really devotes himself to the class and students.,"This class hugely improved my ability to think about difficulties in developing policy around technologies, and about the interactions of technology, society, and governance.","This course is interesting, hilarious, insightful, engaging, very manageable, and changes your approach to technology regardless of your background. I love the interdisciplinary nature of the people accepted to this course and the issues we covered. This course inspired me to write a government thesis on the topics we covered in lecture. Professor Waldo is one-of-a-kind. Apply for this class (get creative, humor helps), and be ready for a class unlike most at Harvard.","Definitely take this class if you can get in, there are multiple topics in this class that blew my mind, I thought previously that I was oversuspicious etc but this course objectively shows you how far into the Panopticon we have descended in the most subtle way. It also teaches you to write position papers very well and gets you to think in depth about real world policy/regulatory implications. Super interesting class, Professor Waldo is amazing,","Worth taking. Ideally it would more rigorously examine both the relevant technology and policy issues, but it's still a fun and interesting survey of the core problems with privacy and technology. Big, big bonus points for being directly applicable to students' everyday concerns and experiences (and kudos to the teaching staff for actively trying to keep the course relevant to these concerns and experiences).","This is an incredible class, but don't sleep on it. It's a good amount of writing. I almost think of it more as a government/policy class than a computer science class, but as a cs person it really pushed me to grow. I've learned an incredible amount in this class.","Think of this class as an HBS course. While this class generally does not use a case study method, the way you learn things is very much through discussing ideas then applying them to the world around you. It isn't often that you get this in the context of computer science, and it is a welcome shift. There is a reason this course is heavily lotteryed, but if you get in you're going to have a good time.","EVERYONE should try and be in this class. Even though Professor Waldo would probably say that the class is half ""techies"" and half ""policy kids,"" don't be deterred if you don't fit either of these description. As digital natives in today's day and age, anybody has the interest and skillset required for a class like this. The class forces you to consider questions of privacy and technology that you have probably dabbled over discussions before briefly, but haven't really considered in depth. By nature of the class size and the application process (which is super easy, even though you'd be surprised how many people this prevents from trying for the class), you get to know the people in the class and Professor Waldo (who is awesome). The class changes as events unfold which makes it even better (ie. email threat scandal), and Jim Waldo's position within the university gives a really interesting perspective on privacy in the context of Harvard. TAKE THIS CLASS, EVERYONE!","The content of this course was really interesting. As someone with no tech background, I learnt a lot from it, and also developed a desire to learn more in the future. Professor Waldo was informative, enthusiastic, and understanding of the fact that the class had a wide variety of people with different interests and skills. The course structure could sometimes be a bit annoying: the bi-weekly group papers are a nightmare to coordinate, especially if you are travelling on the weekends. The readings are somewhat inconsequential and don't come up in class: some are interesting to read anyway, though plenty of them are not.","Definitely take this class! I took it for the gen ed requirement and it's the only gen ed class I've taken that I think actually gave me useful information for daily life. Professor Waldo is great, it's not too much of a time commitment, and you get to cover some really interesting topics!","This class is completely eye opening. You should absolutely take it, and be prepared to learn a lot of shocking things about privacy that you take for granted.","This course was very enjoyable--one of my favorite courses I have taken here at Harvard. Professor Waldo is one of the best professors I've encountered. The course might have been better, had I had a little background in technology and computer science (there were some conversations in class in which I felt I wasn't fully equipped to participate in), but the environment of the class was such that no matter what type of background you came from, there was still much to learn and enjoy."
COMPSCI 109: Data Science,"Only take this if you are very comfortable with programming and statistics, it's honestly completely self-driven and you just have to figure it out for yourself. If you can do that, it's really easy.",This class is good because it is really applicable and the classification/data analysis portion was actually very interesting. Drawbacks are that psets are graded very randomly and truly depends on your tf.,"Really interesting material. Psets are fairly straightforward to get done but can take a lot of time (difficult, but graded leniently so it balances out). No tests, just psets and final project, which is a great setup.","I learned a lot of extremely useful material (python, data manipulation, pandas library, how to make a website for the final project).  However, the class was extremely frustrating because up until the final problem set the questions on the problem sets were very unclear. I spent about 3/4 of my time trying to understand the questions, and only 1/4th of my time actually answering the questions.","A very fun and easy class (depending on your background) that teaches you the basic steps in order to be a data scientist.  I had taken several APMTH courses and CS50 and didn't find the course very difficult.  That said, if you start the problem sets early, you'll run into some problems because the staff would continually email out changes to the assignments.  Piazza will be your friend and the TFs really do try to help everyone out, so it you a stuck, the answer to your problems will most likely be on Piazza.  Start the final projects early because the data collection will take the most amount of time!","The professors who taught the course in my year were not engaging, motivating, inspiring. Lectures were very dull, and to be honest you do not need to go to any lecture to be able to do well in the HW assignments and final project. But the topic of the course is interesting, and if you're willing to teach yourself Python and explore things on your own, then you get the most out of it, without needing great, engaging professors.","This class provides a good foundation for doing data science. I think the most valuable takeaway was the final project, which includes creation of a website which I plan to show to employers. If you want to do data science or even software engineering, it's good to start building your portfolio of projects, and this class will give you one to add to the list. Make sure you get a good team you can learn from. I recommend being the second-dumbest person on your team so you're not completely overwhelmed but you're learning from your peers.",The psets were horribly done. The topics are cool but the psets are structured in a way that does not teach the material. Also lectures are pretty irrelevant.,"This is an excellent course for anyone trying to learn Python from scratch and combine it with statistical understanding, especially of predictions.",This course is awesome!,"The material this course offers is extremely valuable. It’s a wonderful commitment device for learning data wrangling and python’s most useful libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib). That said, the problem sets were often unclear and unnecessarily tedious. They did get a bit better over the course of the term – the course heads were learning – but be ready to rely heavily on piazza for clarifications and additional direction. I’m extremely thankful that I took this course. I did not know python before it and now feel extremely comfortable.  I can do so much exploratory data analysis and apply machine learning algorithms from libraries without difficulty. I must say it’s one of the most useful courses I’ve ever taken.","This course should be great. The subject matter is very interesting and it is great to be able to do actual data science on real data sets. However, it is poorly structured. The lectures were pointless and very poorly taught. The homework assignments were graded almost at random. And I didn't feel like I actually learned much. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you already know you wanted to do data science and even then just to have a class on your transcript named data science.","This class is really interesting -- I definitely learned a lot about how to collect data from the web and how to use it for analysis. While you do need to know how to code (CS50 is enough) you don't need to have any python knowledge to do well. The lectures are not required, but are actually very interesting if you go and pay attention. The problem sets are only every other week (which is amazing!!) but are somewhat frustrating. It's not always clear what you're supposed to do, so piazza will be your best friend. The final project is also a ton of fun and a great way to apply what you've learned on something that matters to you!","To be straight to the point:
1) Lecture is irrelevant and unnecessary. I attended one lecture 3 weeks before the semester ended and counted less than 5 undergrad.
2) Problem Sets are somewhat of a mess. For example, one pset was so poorly written that piazza essentially blew up. Instead of rewriting the pset, they gave a 3 day extension. I really don't understand who thought that would be an acceptable solution to the problem.
3) This class can best be summed up as ""CS people don't really learn anything about Stat in this class, and Stat people don't really learn anything about CS in this class"". Class was pretty easy overall once one figured out to use pandas and python. 
4) Office hours for this class are a disaster. 1 TF for >15 students, assuming the TF actually shows up (which didn't always happen)","This course has very interesting subject matter, but the course components still need to be improved. Lectures were often not very engaging, and problem sets were unnecessarily confusing and unclear. It is a highly marketable class for interviews but I would not recommend it unless you have a very clear interest in data science.","This class will improve your Python skills, so it might be worthwhile for that reason. Otherwise you won't get a ton out of it.","This class is excellent from a practical perspective. You get out of it what you put into it, and if you put the work in to learn not only the computer science aspects but the intuition behind the statistics, you will be ably rewarded.","If they want to learn about the basics of machine learning, how to use python and strengthen their statistical knowledge, then this is the course for them. Doing the problem set is the most helpful feature in this class.",Spend time on the problem sets and you'll be fine,"it is not particularly organized and the lectures are not particularly engaging. moreover, the lectures do not relate fully to the coursework and the problem sets. the final project is very vague and abstract as well.","The Fall 2014 offering of this course was mediocre at best. The assignments were very vague (except for the very last one). For the final project, I didn't feel like we were very well prepared to perform exploratory analysis or machine learning techniques. The intuition for each step of the final project came from prior experience and logic rather than stuff we learned in class. Overall, unless Blitzstein and Pfister teach this class again, I would recommend it with reservation.","The topic is absolutely relevant, and depending on the instructors the course could be (and has been) done really well. Prospective students should see videos of the current year's instructors teaching, if possible, to see if it fits them.","As long as you've taken the prerequisites, this class won't be difficult. However, it's terribly organized and the problem sets take forever because you have to spend hours on Piazza for each one tracking down corrections for all the typos and poorly worded questions in the pset specs. Seriously, all the problem sets would have taken half as long to complete if an English-speaking TF had bothered to proofread them before releasing them. Lecture is wildly uninformative and honestly not really worth attending. This is one of those classes you can forget about until a couple days before each biweekly problem set is due.","Some interesting topics and problem sets, but organization and materials need a lot of work.","It's a good intro to data analysis in Python, with some intro machine learning techniques thrown in as well. If you have prior experience with Python, it will be really easy. The problem sets were very unclear at times though, which was very frustrating. It seemed like the course staff didn't even bother to proof read the assignments, and just answered the floods of questions after the fact on Piazza.","This class is about as community college as it gets at Harvard. Some of the skills you may pick up are useful (scraping, basic ML concepts).","It's a very easy class, but you're unlikely to learn a great deal.","I liked this class a lot. It was a bit disorganized and the psets were often not clear, but the instructors and TF's are really nice and helpful and I really enjoyed the material.","The material is extremely interesting, but I think the department is still working out kinks on how its best taught. I'm sure that the course will keep evolving to be an even better class.",work on interesting psets... don't really need to go to class though.  it is good for getting familiar with pandas and data science questions.,"Lectures were more useful than I thought they'd be for the problem sets. I really liked what the problem sets were trying to teach. However, they weren't well written and I felt like I spent way too much to trying to understand what the question was asking. It's an okay class that can definitely be improved a lot.","This is a truly great class.  It's definitely work and very challenging especially if you don't have a lot of experience with programming languages.  It is so worth it though, because you gain a specific, interesting and important skill set.  Your grade is entirely based on homework and the final project which is nice.  The homework sets and lectures don't necessarily correlate a ton.  Most of the learning is done in doing the homework.  There's lots of TFs to help with the homework.  If you have a solid computer science background this class will be a breeze.  Otherwise, it will be a great challenging class.  Worth it.","Pretty interesting intro to data science. If you've had CS before, this class won't be too time consuming, but it can be tough otherwise.",Probably one of the most useful classes at Harvard. Learning Python and applied statistics will change your life.,Take it if you're interested in Data Science. Also one of the only classes at Harvard that teaches something practical.,"This class was an absolutely abomination of bad planning. There was literally zero organization, the TFs were not accessible and honestly extremely confused. No one seemed to have any idea what was going on. The problem sets could have been interesting, but ended up being tedious rearranging of dataframes. The professors were ineffective lecturers and the material presented in lecture was pretty much irrelevant to everything else in the class.","It would be possible to take this course without experience in Python (I did not have experience in Python), but it is extremely difficult, and will require using outside resources to learn.","This is a very cool and practical class. The problem sets are all based off interesting real-life examples and are fun to complete. Having them due every other week (with plentiful late days) certainly does make the class more manageable. Lecture can seem simple, but go anyway - it's sometimes very cool. It's very manageable without CS50 experience - just be prepared to work hard to master python in the first few weeks.","From what I heard, this class was really really good last year; however, with the changing of professors, its quality dipped... I would say that it's worthwhile to take this class to learn how to manipulate data in python, which is very applicable to other classes. That being said, it wasn't the best taught course and it required a LOT of self-learning. Also, the lectures were mostly irrelevant.","CS109 was almost completely a waste of time. Other than learning how to generate plots and work with dataframes in python, you don't really get much out of the class. If you want to learn about data science, you should just take STAT139/149 and CS181. The psets were fairly easy, but mostly because they were pointless.

For the final project, having both a website and a video is total overkill.","Think about it carefully if you do not have stats background. You can learn a lot from this course, but it will be hard.","Okay, but assignments are really buggy and the course feels half-baked at times.","This class has the potential to be very beneficial. Unfortunately, this was only it's second year, and both the original first year teachers were on sabbatical. The class felt grossly short of what I expected it to be and what I had heard from first year students. There was no reason to go to class, the assignments were unintelligible, and the material we learned was heavily based on Machine Learning, even though this class is not CS181. It is not hard to get good grades, but you could learn this class in a weekend from a Python for Data Analysis O'Reiley book.

Note that I took this class with the replacement teachers, so everything I say could change when the original professors come back and teach this class for the second time.","Definitely approach this class at your own risk. The homework assignments sometimes required too much ""clariifcaiton"" and there are a wide range of skill levels. Nevertheless the grading for the homework was extremley fair.","The stuff you do in this class is objectively very, very cool. We had problem sets that had us analyzing MLB players' salaries, looking at poll results (in order to predict the midterm elections, which we had a contest for), building a good/bad wine classifier, and more. It's not a very challenging class if you have basic stat knowledge (basically the equivalent of AP stat in high school) and coding experience. The lectures are kind of boring but like I said they're more than made up for with the problem sets in which you look at real data to draw conclusions and feel like a true data scientist. Highly recommended!",Good class only if the problem sets are written with more care.,Be prepared to learn on your own. Start problem sets early.,"Take it to practice your skills on the problem sets. Data science is really really important to science, finance, and a lot of other fields. That said, the course didn't seem to be very well organized. Lectures are a waste of time.","This class has high aspirational intentions, but it does not really cut it. The lectures and the homework assignments barely tie together, if at all. The homework assignments were confusing to follow, and they don't really teach you how to apply methods in data science. However, the last assignment became a little bit closer to being comprehensible. The overall problem of the course might stem from the problem of making the class general enough that students without CS and/or stat background can take it, so that it breezes over both concepts without much depth.",This is a great intro to data science and the different methods it employs. You'll also realize how useful statistics and algorithms are in solving really interesting real world problems! Psets can be very time-intensive at first if you're not familiar with python/pandas.,"this class is great for beginners who don't have perfectly advanced cs skills and who are interested in statistics. stat 100 is good enough preparation, although be prepared to look up a few things that are related to statistical algorithms. Course graders take into account cs background","What you get out of this class depends entirely on the knowledge you have coming in and the amount of time you put into the course.

If you have minimal CS experience (e.g. just CS50) then be prepared to learn a lot of Python. This is actually a really good thing, and this class is a great way to get a handle on standard Python use. However, it will take a lot of time and I'd imagine it will be frustrating as well.

If you have a decent to large amount of programming knowledge, then this class will be easy but frustrating.

In short, take this class if you have a lot of CS experience and want to put in a few hours every two weeks for an easy class, or have a small amount of CS knowledge and are ok with putting in a lot of time to learn a lot of practical computing skills.","The course this year was disorganized. The lectures were not useful and over half the TFs did not host any office hours. This is completely unacceptable because for many students office hours are essential to answer lasting questions and completing the PSETs. The PSETs were often riddled with vague problems which would require constant checking on Piazza to confirm one interpretation of the problem over another.

I am also not sure why Stephanie Hicks is listed as the head TF if she  does not perform any teaching duties. If ""teaching"" means administrative duties like checking if PSETs are submitted and sending them off for other TFs to grade, then I guess I may stand corrected.

The content of the PSETs and the applicability of this course to real world problems are the redeeming factors of this course. I really enjoyed how the course forces you to learn python very quickly in order to tackle predictions and problems such as predicting the result of the 2014 Senate Midterm Elections. 

Biweekly PSETs took about 15-20 hours for me to complete, but I think this time could have been shaved off if provided organized resources, access to the office hours of all TFs, and if we had more instructors who actually cared about making the learning experience a fruitful one. I am sure the professors were well intended, but unfortunately the result for students has not really reflected their well intentions.","Be warned that this class is a lot of meticulous work that is not necessarily very satisfying. You'll spend hours searching how to correctly enter a single line of code. Too much of your time is spent on details, and too little of it actually understanding the concepts and strategies behind data science","A fun course teaching very practical and applicable skills. It is good for learning how to wrangle and clean datasets, but the statistical material is covered in a somewhat superficial manner. I would have enjoyed a greater level of rigor. It might be worth taking this and then CS 181, for greater depth on the topics covered.","Pretty easy, knowing python before is a plus.","Expect the homework sets to take a long time, but the questions are usually interesting and real-world applicable.  Lectures aren't always the most useful but lab (which no one went to?) was great for practical tips on how to complete the homework.  You'll definitely get a working knowledge of how to use ipython notebooks for statistical models, which I hear is practical in the real world...","This class has a lot of potential to be really cool, but it's definitely not there yet. The problem with this course is that it didn't really work to build on itself, but instead felt like a lot of unrelated topics and a lot of exercise in coding in python rather than learning techniques that data scientists should be using. The material is pretty cool, but it's easily lost in the mess that is cleaning up data, but then again I guess that is a big component of data science.","A great course on data science, but the lectures are not very helpful or instructive. The homework is definitely stimulating and is the main thing that teaches you the material.","I'm pretty sure this class didn't teach me a single thing.  I became more aware of data science terms and the tools that exist, but that's about it.",This class is a great introduction to what data science is like. You'll be able to use Python by the end of the course to work with and analyze data.,"Take it if you're interested in data science. Taught poorly in my opinion this year, but the professors will be different next year.","Never went to class. Psets are quite badly written. Maybe if you put more work into it, it would be more useful, but otherwise it's not the best taught class.","This class will teach you a lot about practical and useful techniques in data science, but the lectures were often unsatisfactory and felt irrelevant to the matter at hand. But if you're willing to teach yourself Python, then it's a class worth taking.",Good class. Prepare for the final project ahead of time.,"A decent course, but at this point in time potentially not worth the substantial time commitment it requires."
COMPSCI 121: Introduction to the Theory of Computation,"Given that I came in with no real proof-based background (the last time I did proofs was at a math camp the summer after my sophomore year of high school), it was a difficult course. That said, it wasn't impossible — I don't know how much CS20 really would have helped with it seeing as many of the topics seemed self-contained, and were ""easy"" enough to grasp with just the book and course material. I took it when I didn't have to (I'm not a CS concentrator), and I don't regret it. It was a good course, Harry Lewis seemed like he was invested in teaching it, and most of the TF's were willing to help (though some were rather snarky). It's interesting material, and I feel like it's worth knowing.","Wish it wasn't required of CS concentrators because its a very very hard class for those of us who don't have a strong math background.  It is a good class though.  If you don't have much math background (even if you took CS20) might be smart to go over some of the material and notation beforehand, that probably would have made the class a bit less painful.","Make sure you have exposure to this type of math before, don't be huberistic and take CS20 if you did not take Math 25+","This is not a very difficult course if you go to lectures, section, and put in the work for the assignments. Go to office hours because they are great for getting the problem sets done, and done correctly.",This class is very interesting but will definitely require a lot of time since there are problem sets every single week - no time to digest information in between psets.,"Looking at the Q Guide you can see that there are a lot of people who don't like this course. But honestly, it is a great class. I think most of the people who don't like it are the more traditional CS students. But, if you are coming from another discipline (like Physics or Math), I think it can be a lot of fun! The problems are very well laid out and fun to figure out how to solve. It is more of an exercise in thinking in creative ways than anything else. Definitely would recommend this class to science and math people. You definitely learn a lot. This is probably in the top 8 classes I have taken at Harvard in my 4 years here.","Would not recommend. Hate theory, hate math, hate proofs, don't understand anything. It's mandatory anyway so you're screwed. My section TF was amazing though. Go to Office Hours, they rock and will get so much help. Also team up with classmates (up to 4 collaborators). Tests aren't that bad.","If you love math and computer science, particularly abstract math, then this class is for you. It is not however, particularly enthralling.","1) Unfortunately you have to take this class. Bummer. 
2) The material is pretty boring and not really relevant to anything you'll ever do in the field of computer science or at a job
3) Know proof math coming in, otherwise this class will be extremely difficult","If you are concentrating in CS, you have to take this class. That being said, it can be a very interesting class, and touches upon topics that you can go into further.",Only take it if it is required.,"Some people may feel that this class has no practical use; however, I would say that it teaches students how to approach problems from a computational point of view. I can see how these underlying concepts may come in useful in the future. That being said, lecture/section/textbook all cover the same material in various ways. I would say you could pick 2 of them and ignore 1.","I found the material of this course very interesting.  It's pretty cool how far you can go in terms of complexity theory with a few basic math tools.  I'm glad it's a requirement for the CS department, what with so many of us having a more applied/programming focus.  That said, I think it could be taught a bit better.  Lewis seems bored by the material, and he often was more or less reading off of slides.  Reading Sipser was honestly more helpful than watching the lectures.","Don't bother going to lecture, section covers the material just as well and in a less confusing manner. Lewis is not a very good lecturer, and constantly makes mistakes in his slides and explanations. It's frankly a little unacceptable how many times it happened this semester.","If you're not a CS concentrator, I don't recommend taking this class. It's incredibly difficult and most people who didn't need to take it had trouble motivating themselves to do the problem sets well.","If you are strong at proof based math, this class is definitely manageable. I don't have much computer science background but more math and found this class very enjoyable. Don't go to lecture. They're very dry and unnecessary to learn the material. Instead read the textbook and go to section. Those and going to office hours, finding a good pset group will make you get a good grade in this class.",Read Sipser. Keep up in class. Go to office hours. The exams are extremely fair. It's not difficult to do well (even coming in without a proofs background) because of the way the class is structured--75% is psets/midterm and the lowest gets dropped. I think it's one of those classes that teaches not the most interesting topic in the world but definitely something worth knowing about in general.,"This class is clearly a lot different from most other CS classes early in your curriculum. You won't be writing code or debugging; instead, you'll be gaining a mathematically rigorous introduction to problems in computability theory, algorithmic complexity, etc. Some of the topics (particularly near the end of the course) are very interesting and seem like important issues. The first half of the course isn't terrible, but it was sometimes very hard to grasp the motivations or significance behind concepts. I did not attend lecture for most of the class; I thought Prof. Lewis was perfectly fine, but the lecture slides (in combination with the Sipser textbook) were definitely good enough to cover the material.

In terms of difficulty, the class was not terrible. The workload was substantial, but not overwhelming; I spent around 5-8 hours per week on problem sets, in most cases. The problem sets are interesting, and they make up a very large portion of the final grade, which makes it not too hard to do well in the class. In terms of background/prerequisites, you just need to be able to think about and write tight, mathematically rigorous proofs. If you can do that (or are willing to work a little harder to pick up the skill), you'll be fine.","CS121 is interesting and necessary for future classes, but definitely not the highlight of the cs department.","If you're a CS concentrator you're going to have to take this class, and you'll probably be pretty ambivalent toward it.

If you're not a CS concentrator, you're not going to take this class.","I took this class expecting it to be a joke, but it actually turned out to be a lot more difficult than I was expecting. I'm not really sure why it's required for all CS concentrators, but you learn some really interesting stuff. Lecture isn't really worth attending, but the textbook (Sipser) is pure gold, and section is great too. I would strongly recommend finding a study group and going to office hours if you haven't had much experience with proofs and/or sets.","Coming to lecture is boring, but the best parts are section and office hours. The hardest thing is being formal with proofs.","The course textbook Sipser is clear and thorough in explaining concepts and the class pretty much follows the textbook. Problem sets take a lot of time and you should definitely plan to go to at least one office hours for each pset. Also, for the exams, do all the practice midterms and final exams first before reviewing material. There is a lot that is not going to be tested in the exams.",If you are a CS major you probably have to take this. It's actually more interesting than you think. Not particularly applicable for me but I guess it's a good perspective on theoretical computer science.,"This is a fine class. You're probably taking it because you have to, but if not I would still recommend it. If you've never done proofs before you can still totally do fine in the course, and you'll gain a decent bit of mathematical maturity in the process(really a basis for further exploration--you get exposed to basic ideas like proof by construction/contradiction, reduction, etc. which are staples of mathematical activity). 

The class does become slightly more involved as the semester goes on, but the material becomes more interesting and significant as time goes on(you'll go from drawing finite automata to dealing with P vs. NP, one of the most famous unsolved problems in all of mathematics).

Professor Lewis is not the most compelling lecturer, but can be pretty funny at times. Most people don't attend lecture(the class had 150 in it this year but only 15 or so would be at any given lecture) and I'd say that watching the videos at 1.5x speed is probably the best way to go. Lecture can be pretty slow and we sometimes get bogged down in details that we won't ever really need, even for the problem sets and exams--in fall fairness I understand Lewis is just trying to give things proper context a lot of the time. Sipser is great, so read that over attending lecture if you're ever really pressed for time. 

Also, the grades on problem sets tend to be pretty high, so make sure you clearly explain your solutions in detail and check your work twice! I felt at times that TFs had to take points off for irrelevant things just to bring the mean down. Also, do always try the extra credit! Even if you don't get towards an answer they're good exercises, and if other people do them then it'll be tougher to be ahead of the curve.",Not useful at all.,"I don't know why this class gets such a bad reputation and Q Score.  I am a statistics concentrator and I thought that this class was really enjoyable.  The stuff we learned felt like a good use of time and I'm glad I learned it!  The PSets were well designed and everything seemed fair.  Plus, Lewis is fun!","Come into the class with an open mind and some of the material can get quite interesting near the end of the course with the perennial P vs NP problem and other important computational theories. If you are the theoretical/mathematical type, this course is suitable for you!","I thought this was a solid course. Reasonable problem sets, reasonable exams. The textbook for the course is excellent. You can do well by just reading the textbook each week rather than going to lecture.","If you're a CS concentrator, you're required to take this class.  Thankfully, it's not that bad.  The lectures are usually pretty boring and not very well attended, but you can usually get by via reading the book and reading the lecture slides.  The pace of the class is slow which is great since the material does get difficult.  Overall, it's a tough CS course but it certainly won't destroy your semester.","I really enjoyed this course, and it definitely helped round out my appreciation for what CS is as a discipline.  If you work hard on the problem sets you should be well prepared for the exams.","If you at all may be interested in theoretical computer science, you pretty much have to take this class. Considering this class is required of all CS concentrators, you'll probably take this class whether you want to or not, but don't see it as a bad thing necessarily; some aspects of this class are actually really enjoyable!",Not really worth taking unless you have to.  Material easy to learn by yourself.,"I totally understand why this is a required course for CS: it's a great reminder that computer science != programming, and that there's actually some really cool theory behind it. Lewis isn't the most exciting lecturer, and the pace of the class is pretty slow if you have any background in proof-based math, but the material mostly makes up for that (especially when you get past automata to the P vs. NP part of the class!). I haven’t heard much about 125, but I’d recommend shopping/taking it instead if you want to learn this stuff from a more mathematically rigorous perspective.","CS requirement, can't help it. But still very useful stuff. Just do like what everybody says: don't go to lecture and just read Sipser. That's the way to go.",This class is very hard. The psets take a really long time but they are manageable.,"Material is tough but the class is well structured and well organized.  If you think you will struggle with the material, take CS20 in the spring.  Then just rip the bandaid with this one.","Professor Lewis is not bad -- not extremely engaging, but very knowledgeable.  The material is really interesting.  If you have a strong math background, this course may very well be easy for you, if not, it may be a struggle (people who've already taken 124 tend to have a very easy time with this class).","Well, you all have to take this course since it is a CS requirement. The sort of nice thing is that you get to meet a lot of CS concentrators, and Harry Lewis is an interesting character. The drawback is that the content is probably not something you are going to be that interested in, and if you are good at formal mathematics you will find the course pretty easy. I recommend it - but only because if you didn't take it you wouldn't get your CS degree.","CS 121 is a very gentle introduction to theoretical computer science, and I definitely recommend taking it earlier rather than later (coming from someone who took it junior fall). While your possible suspicion that it won't make you a better developer or be useful in your future career is certainly founded, it is useful in that it teaches you to translate mathematical skills into the world of CS and allows you to looks at the problems of computer science and understand them – something anyone involved in technology should be able to do.","If you're a CS concentrator, you have to take this class. It's not bad, nor is it difficult--I felt like I learned a decent amount from lectures, though the first half of the course moves excruciatingly slowly. That said, it doesn't take up too much time, especially if you read Sipser instead of going to lecture.","It's pretty helpful to have taken CS20 before CS121. If you don't have any formal proof background, the class may be a bit difficult to adjust to. The section TFs were awesome - especially Tom. He was the most helpful TF ever, and he made the material a lot easier to understand. 

Expect this class to take around 5-10 hours a week for you.","I don't think this class should be required of CS concentrators. It is definitely useful though, and reasonably difficult and time consuming. Harry Lewis is a very entertaining and interesting teacher. The class is very reasonable overall and relatively painless, I just wish I didn't have to take it because it seemed like a waste of a class to me.","I was a little afraid to take this course because of the prerequisites, as I did not have any experience with proofs, since I decided not to take Math 23 or CS20. But, I felt that I was strong enough mathematically to take this course, and I sure am glad that I did. I really gained a lot from this course, in addition to learning to write proofs, it really made me think in a different way and expanded my problem solving abilities.

But, there are some concerns. The lectures are absolutely useless. Harry Lewis is a very slow teacher, and you can probably watch his lectures at 2x speed, but even that might not be necessary. You can learn all the material needed for this course from the textbook, Sipser, which is a godsend.",If you're CS you have to take. Try to not get behind or it can get difficult quickly. Also make sure you do very well on the psets,"You have to take it, and it can be illuminating, but you probably won't like it.","It's the class you kind of just have to take. It isn't awful, and ultimately, you do learn. It's not taught particularly well (not going to lecture will not hurt you - just read Sipser, seriously) and there definitely isn't as much content taught as could be. If you have a math background, you could take this freshman fall. If you don't, any CS experience will help, and it'll be a bit tougher. That being said, don't expect it to be hard or particularly fascinating, but don't expect it to be torturous.","It's a great class, and the material is really interesting. That being said, the teaching staff (unless you have a really great TF), doesn't really make it that engaging -- it almost feels as if the class plods along and just drones through material. But stick with it -- the content of the course is actually really cool when you step back and look at it!","The material can be interesting sometimes, but if you're already comfortable with mathematical proofs, then you should probably take CS 125 to get through the CS 121 material at a faster pace (assuming that CS 125 still does justice to CS 124, which I can't say for sure).","I think that this is a really important class to take for computer science. While it was challenging and definitely took a lot of consistent work throughout the semester, I learned a lot. If I had looked at our final exam when I first started the class, I would not have even known what was being asked or how to begin solving the problem. But by the end of the semester, I knew how to solve difficult problems and understood their applications.","I would like them to realize that this course is a department requirement. I'm sure Professor/Dean Lewis is a great administrator that loves undergraduate education and is an excellent administrator and department head, but I find it unfortunate that he should be forced to spend some time teaching this course which could benefit from having a different course head. Perhaps after having taught the class for some many years, Professor Lewis feels as if less time can be spent on the course but the course feels as if it could use a fresh look. The material is relevant, interesting and important and I would love to be able to recommend the course to people even remotely interested in CS because of how much the material should be exciting. Unfortunately, it feels that I can only describe the course as a concentration credit and nothing else. That is a major shame. 

The course is very doable for anyone. Those afraid of proofs or concerned about their math background or not having taken CS20 probably shouldn't be worried. The course requires sharp thinking which all Harvard students possess. The psets take some time to do, especially for those new to the subject area but the course is not a time black hole. Work wise, its very doable and the material is interesting and applicable, even if that is not immediately obvious.","Lecture can be a bit dry, but the material was actually more interesting than I expected (though most of it will come directly from Sipser). Assignments can be extremely challenging, especially if this is your first proof-based class (as it was for me). Try not to be discouraged - just make sure to go to office hours and, if needed, find a tutor through the BSC. You will get through it, and you may actually end up liking it.","Despite what people may say about cs121, it is a really good class.  Read the textbook and you'll be set.  Be prepared to form a study group / attend office hours to get through some of the psets, but the exams are really fair.  Overall it's a pretty good class and lays a solid foundation in computational theory.",Read Sipser! It's the best textbook that I've used for a course. Make sure to check psets with classmates and to go to office hours.,Have a relatively strong theoretical math background (at the level of cs20),1) you have to take it if you're a CS major 2) you'll like it if you're into math 3) it actually turns out it's pretty useful,"If you've never done serious formal proofs before, get some guidance from a TF earlier rather than later. If that technical stuff isn't a problem then the course shouldn't be too hard at all.","If you've taken Math 25 or up and thought it was a decent class, not unmanageable, then avoid 121 by all means. It's a waste of time, and you would get much more reward from 125. Regardless of what you've heard about how hard 125, 121 is just a total waste of a semester.

If you have no proof training but still want to major in CS, then take 121, I guess.

As for the class itself, Lewis is well prepared for lectures, but he's a godawful boring lectures. I never managed to go to class; I tried for a while to watch the recordings, but even then I could get through three lecture's worth of material by reading the textbook in the time it took Lewis to teach half a lecture.","It's really not hard if you already have a proof based math background. The problem sets were also fun to do, and mostly doable without help.","Please take CS20 if you're not used to writing proofs / formal mathematic notation like I was. It immensely helped me. This class is difficult, but definitely doable if you have the right support network. We were allowed to work in groups on the problem sets, which was good for my mental health.","If you're taking this course, it's because you're required to.","It's a good course, but the material isn't directly applicable to coding (you won't write code in this class) and it's highly theoretical.","This is a sad implementation of a theory course. The material is interesting, but Harry's lectures are not. It's a pity that the only required course is so poorly taught.","This course is difficult, but necessary. It wasn't till halfway through that I realized how valuable some of the material is. While you'll never apply it directly while programming, it definitely further your understanding of computers as a whole. The end of the course on P vs. NP is particularly interesting. Lectures are poorly taught, so section and more importantly the textbook will be very useful. I strongly recommend taking CS20 before taking this, your grade will thank you.","This class is actually more interesting than you would think. The problems that we work on are very satisfying to think through, and it gives you great experience in proofs. It is manageable without prior experience in higher math, as long as you are willing to put the work in. The lectures are fairly dull, but it is possible to learn the material without relying on them.","This course is definitely do-able. While you might be intimidated coming into it since it does have the potential to be an extremely difficult class, if you read through Sipser in detail and STUDY WITH OTHER PEOPLE, you will find that the course material is not bad at all. I thought it was easier than Stat 110.","You learn a lot about a very interesting area of computer science.  The course is well taught, and the textbook matches up nicely to it.  Professor Lewis's anecdotes and historical asides keep things interesting in a good way.  If you ever have issues, you can get them sorted out in section.  Only one other student ever showed up for my section, so I had a lot of opportunity to get help.  Also, Piazza helps a lot with the problem sets.  The problem sets can be challenging, but you get to drop one.  And the tests are much easier than the problem sets.  I would recommend taking this class even if you're not a CS major, provided you like mathematical proofs and logic.",This is a really good class. It taught me a lot. I absolutely loved how helpful the teaching fellows were at office hours. Gabe and Ben were my favorite :) Just be ready to work hard outside of your class. Your critical thinking skills will definitely improve if you take this class.,"Psets are really important (75% of grade), so stay on top of them. Exams are straightforward but difficult.",I mean if you're a CS concentrator you don't have much choice....,"If you're a CS major, might as well get it over with. The material was unexpectedly engaging, and it really changes the way you think about the notion of computation, which is fantastic. But in the end, I'm glad I got it over with.","It's a math class, not a CS class.","Sipser is the best textbook I've ever used. And boy did I use it a lot. This class starts out really slow, but the content gets more interesting and actually applicable to real life toward the end. Depending on how good you are at math, problem sets are pretty tough. All in all I appreciate the content matter of the class as a whole, but the way this class was taught made it really uninteresting. Don't expect to get any useful feedback from assignments.","I love this class. It was hard for me (minimal proof-y background), that's for sure, but I learned awesome amounts. CS 121 <3.","Lectures are pretty dry and a bit hard to pay attention to. The material itself also isn't the most interesting thing in the world, but Sipser is a good resource.",read the relevant chapters of textbook and watch the lectures if  you have time,"This class is pretty boring unless you are mathematically minded. If you're a CS concentrator you have to take it, so tough luck. If you aren't a CS concentrator, I'd advise you to ask yourself, ""Do I like math?"" before enrolling in this course. It's not very hard though if you have some mathematical background, just boring.",Only take tins course if you have prior interest or if you need it as a prereq,"Challenging course.  P-sets will take a lot of time, office hours are a must.  Read Sipser","It's a good class that everyone interested in computer science should take. As someone who's more interested in the engineering side of computer science, it wasn't my favorite class, but it was definitely well worth my taking it."
COMPSCI 125: Algorithms and Complexity,A really great undergraduate CS theory course where you come out with a strong understanding of basic algorithms and complexity theory. You will learn a lot with great professors and be surrounded by very smart students.,"Good class if you want a fast introduction into a broad selection of theory and algorithms. You won't need too much background, but each week will be mostly new material and you'll be constantly challenged.","It was a really cool class, the instructors were pretty good and very excited about the subject matter!","The class is very interesting, but it does require a huge time commitment. Take only if it can be your first priority this semester.","This course is probably a lot more demanding from a problem-solving perspective than 121 or 124, but the problems themselves are very well-written. The lecture notes are (usually) really clear as well and the TFs were really helpful, so I felt like I could always stay caught up with the class as long as I put the work in. This was the first year that the course was offered, so I'm sure subsequent iterations will be even better!",The class is really challenging but rewarding if you make it through!,"Excellent, well-organized course covering the basics of theoretical computer science. Don't worry about the ""Math 55 of the CS department"" hype; you should find it manageable unless you're coming in with a woefully deficient background.","I wish this course were available when I was a freshman. Now, the CS department joins the other departments in providing a department-endorsed method for freshmen to academically overload themselves in the fall!","If you want to go into research, this is an awesomely fast paced class. If you care about tech job interviews and actual practical applications, it may be better to still take 121 and 124, since they will give you better skills and more practice (124 especially).",Take this class if you want to learn the fundamentals of CS theory with suitable mathematical rigor. I'd say this class is great both for CS concentrators who want an advanced and fast-paced introduction to the subject in lieu of 121 and 124 as well as students in related fields who want to get as much out of a single semester theory course as possible.,"CS125 is a fantastic and fast paced introduction to complexity theory and algorithms. The professors are fantastic, the TFs were on point, and I really can't recommend this class enough. Take it to learn theoretical CS, take it to get good at job interviews, or take it just to work on cool problems.","It's definitely a lot of work, and moves very quickly. The proof-based problem sets are challenging and very time consuming, but help you get a greater understanding of the material. I would say that it's possible to get them done on your own if you are super confident in this area already, but it's very helpful getting a second opinion on your solutions.
Mitzenmacher and Salil were great professors. Point blank. You'll learn a lot from them (and be in awe of how much they know/have accomplished.) 
It's imperative to study on your own and do practice problems before exams, but the exams are fair (if challenging), though it's hard to say what future iterations of this course will look like (if it even happens again), it seems they're slowly calibrating the difficulty of the course. I feel like they initially wanted it to be harder, but (1) crazy smart people stopped attending lecture, and (2) lots of people who took the first midterm and dropped tended to complain about the difficulty, leaving the rest of the class up the river.
I loved the class. Better taking a hard class with great profs than 2 less difficult ones with less exciting profs.","For students looking for a challenging computer science course, I would absolutely recommend CS125. This class challenged me and allowed me to learn a lot about both algorithms/complexity and mathematical proofs for theoretical computer science. Compared to CS121 and CS124, I feel that CS125 goes through the material at a very good pace for the advanced CS student.","I would highly recommend this class. Don't be scared off by the mathematical background the course suggests, I took this with very little exposure to proof based mathematics and I was fine. Be prepared to work hard, especially on the problem sets, which can be very challenging and time-consuming. A course like this seems to be the best way to learn theoretical computer science, with the 121 and 124 material integrated together.","While being advertised as ""the Math 55 of CS,"" this class is certainly not as hard or demanding as Math 55 (coming from a former Math 25er). That being said, it is still very challenging and requires a lot of work and discipline. Out of the ten assignments we had, only one-and-a-half involved any kind of programming and the rest were all proof-based questions. However, it is still necessary to have a solid programming background in order to complete those assignments since very little guidance is given. A strong math background is essential for success in this course, especially discrete math, probability, and familiarity with proofs. You should also be comfortable typing up your homework in LaTeX. We never followed a specific book, but I would recommend Sipser and CLRS as supplements.

The teaching staff was amazing and made it worth it to take the course. Michael Mitzenmacher and Salil Vadhan are two of the best CS professors at Harvard, and taking a class with both of them was a fantastic experience. Alex and Joy were also great TFs (though sadly they will have graduated by next year).

If you enjoy math and were thinking about taking 121 or 124, consider taking 125 instead. Some of the pros are the great teaching staff, the smaller class size (only about 30 people took it this year), and the fact that your peers will be smarter and more passionate about math/CS. Some of the cons are the heavier workload and the tougher exams and grading.","Great class, you really learn a lot about how to make efficient algorithms, and you also learn about the theory of complexity (e.g. how to prove certain algorithms are in certain complexity classes such as P, NP, co-NP, NP-complete, RP, R, RE, and many more). It is a lot of work though, and you will need strong proof-based math experience (e.g. 25 or higher).","Great class, organized well even in its first year. Material is interesting and challenging, but not nearly as difficult as being ""Math 55 for CS"". Comparable to Math 25.","This class is challenging. While the material itself is not *too* bad, the problem sets are meant to be very difficult. You'll come out of the class with an appreciation of how hard computer science can really be, but also showed me the value of rigorous proofs in the construction of computer science and complexity theory. I haven't taken later classes yet, but according to the teaching staff, CS125 should prepare you for graduate coursework in the field. Expect many math and computer science prodigies in this course -- it really does live up to its name.","A really fun class. The lectures move kind of slowly, but the lecture notes are superb, and the problem sets are interesting and reasonable in length.","First of all, I think this course was fantastic - it was probably my favorite course this semester, and it got me interested in theoretical computer science. I would especially recommend this course for concentrators in related fields (Physics, Math, etc.) who are interested in learning more about CS.

However, there are some things you should bear in mind. This was the first year the class was offered, so there may be significant changes between this year and future years (for example, workload was not too high this semester, but that could change). 

Additionally, this class was advertised as being ""an intensive course meant only for students with strong mathematical preparation"", which I think overstates the mathematical complexity of the course. You should have familiarity with proofs in order to take this class, but you should not pay attention to Crimson articles declaring this to be a ""CS equivalent to Math 55"" (unless they significantly change the course next year, which is possible).

Finally, I would just recommend being careful with Prof. Mitzenmacher - he can at times be a little hard to deal with (and digging back in the Q, this is not the first time somebody has made such an observation).

Sorry for the long-winded response; there are a lot of things to mention because the course is new. tl;dr you should strongly consider taking this class, it was extremely cool."
COMPSCI 141: Computing Hardware,"This class, although a bit disorganized, will give you a new found appreciation for your computer.",The course material is interesting but the labs are very time consuming- the last few weeks of the semester I spent ~15 hours a week on just the labs.  This is time outside of the time I spent in class and doing homework assignments.  Just be aware that throughout the course the lab is a significant amount of outside work- I don't think that is always made clear by the teaching staff.,"This is an extremely interesting class, but is definitely time consuming. But you really learn a lot when you spend a significant amount of time debugging code. If you really want to learn about computer architecture, this is definitely a good introduction. I think all CS concentrators should take this course and EE concentrators as well, especially if you're in EE and are interested in the CS side. The lab component is the most time-consuming portion. The problem sets are pretty straightforward and don't require too much time. If the labs were as disorganized as they were this semester, you will constantly be frustrated by the ambiguity of the specifications given to you and spend many hours debugging things that really weren't in your control. But if you have a great partner, the experience is made a little bit better. You definitely bond with your classmates in this course a lot, and as an EE concentrator, I really enjoyed working with CS concentrators.","This class was a brutal grind. Although I learned a lot throughout the course, specifically about computer architecture, FPGA's and verilog, I don't know if it was worth the struggle. The lectures were pretty dull, there are p-sets every week (which typically don't take too long) but the labs are really difficult and lengthy, taking 6-12 hours, sometimes more, each week trying to get your code working. The software we used was really outdated, and the course structure/teaching fellows did not make it easy to get help with the buggy Xilinx program. Avi was extremely helpful throughout the course, but was also very often busy teaching ES52, and certain problems no TFs could help with and they would just refer you to Avi. Overall, a very tough class that took a ton of effort, and while learning a lot, it just seemed like changes should be made to make it more effective and up-to-date.","I would not take this class without significant changes from this year. The material was interesting and the psets were fair but the labs took 30-40 hours a week. There is not enough teaching staff, not enough office hours, and not enough lab staff who actually know Verilog and the lab assignments. The take home exams are long and don't test the material from class","High workload class with both problem sets and labs.  Lectures go over material for the pset / take-home midterm / take-home final, but you can also learn effectively from the textbook.  Lab sections and TFs go over material for the lab.

Labs took me ~7 hours/wk, psets took me ~3 hours/wk.","This class has a lot of great potential. Brooks knows what he's talking about, but the labs need significant improvement.  At the moment, we would spend hours trying to debug code and errors that TFs themselves told us, since they had no idea as to what exactly the code was doing. Yes, I understand that these are all grad school students, but they need to take the time out to prepare for the weekly lab session that they lead.  Don't take the hours as a joke as well.  The psets are really straightforward, but the labs are a pain.","Prof. Brooks teaches well.

If you don't like struggling with implementations, you probably shouldn't take this course.","Be prepared to allocate a lot of time for this course.  I wasn't given any heads up, and I chose other classes that were also time intensive.  That made this class more difficult.",Expect to spend a lot of time on this class.  You are assigned homework and coding assignments (labs) which usually add up to at least 10 to 15 hours per week.,Very interesting material.  Professor Brooks is a good lecturer. Recommend because of just how cool computing hardware can be. The TFs have not invested themselves heavily in the course. The labs are often frustrating. Pretty much all things you will see in every response.,Start the labs as soon as possible because they will take forever to get working properly.,"Very interesting material, but the class was not well run. Exam and midterm were filled with typos. Verilog lesson was after the lab, not before, etc","I have mixed feelings about this course. In my opinion, the labs, while difficult, were the best part of the course, and you really gain an understanding of how a CPU is implemented, because you implement one yourself as the last lab! The labs do take a ton of time, and the 3 hours per week that they allocate for you are really just help sessions where you can ask questions of the TFs and get help. Lectures were pretty dry most of the time, although at times they could be informative and interesting. Problem sets were generally pretty easy (except for pipelining) but very tedious, consisting of hand-translating code into assembly or machine code or drawing large gate diagrams. Exams were similar to the problem sets (we had a midterm and a final, both of the take-home variety). Overall, I thought the amount of stuff I learned in this class and the cool labs outweighed the dryness of the lecture and the tediousness of the problem sets. Full disclosure: I am a CS concentrator with a few more CS classes under my belt than some of the other people in this class who were more EE-focused, so I found the labs easier and the problem sets trickier than they did.","I would not recommend this class at all. Professor Brooks does not care about the class or students. His lecture slides are years old and will likely not be updated anytime soon. He is not involved with assignments or labs. Most of the teaching staff are either incompetent or just do not care/put in enough time to make the labs run smoothly. They do not know exactly what's going on in labs. The due dates and organization of assignments/labs was completely arbitrary, and students in earlier labs did not get the same amount of time to work on them because the labs were released at the same time to all students, while being due at the end of the assigned lab section. It basically felt like taking an exam every week.",Ensure you have necessary time in your schedule to devote to this course.,"The course is awesome and is an absolute staple for EE and CS. You learn how to use Hardware Description Language (Verilog) to design hardware. By the end of the course you will have designed a humbler version of a real computer processor. The problem sets are trivial but the labs take much more than the scheduled 3 hours - think of the labs as the real problem sets and the problem sets as a warm-up. You can easily do the labs alone if you put in the required time and you will learn much more that way as well. If you're familiar with Physics 123, it's essentially the digital portion of Physics 123 continued into the 21's century - there isn't much overlap after the first two weeks. Awesome class - more EE classes should be like this.","The lab are demanding. Make sure to get a good partner, and read the book--the lecture and textbook provide the same amount of information in terms of what is used in labs and assignments.","This class is a lot of work. There are 4 labs, 9 problem sets, 1 midterm, and 1 final. Sounds like your average class? Think again. The 4 labs are split into parts, and it's basically like having double homework every week. If you're okay with the work, it's a great class. Prof Brooks is a wonderful lecturer and teaches you A LOT in a semester. Whether you're an engineer or computer scientist, it's great to know a bit about circuits and computer architecture. Beware, though, the TFs are usually not prepared (save for Sam, the head TF) and will be little of help on all the assignments. The problem sets and labs will also have errors, omissions, and missing details. In general, the course staff could be better prepared. But I believe the knowledge you learn makes it (kind of) worth it.",This class has the potential to be good but it needs a lot of work. In particular the labs need to be re done and it would be good if the teaching staff had better understanding of the material.Overall I would be very careful before enrolling in this course.,"It is great to learn how computers work at a low level. It is empowering to build your own assembler or multi-cycle processor. It is good to build these things for yourself, and learn how to use a FPGA.
However, the virtualbox, which you have to complete the labs in, was unwieldy and annoying. The labs were unrealistically ambitious. It was nearly impossible to complete some of them without significant help from TFs, who were generally unavailable outside of lab time. It was unrealistic to think you could come into lab with questions for the TF and finish it within 3 hours.","The professor obviously doesn't care at all- he is a terrible lecturer and has not even looked at the lab materials. He doesn't have office hours and won't answer any student questions. The material is cool, but don't bother with the class. Take 161 and learn about hardware that way or just read a book..."
COMPSCI 143: Computer Networks,"This class is good for people who learn better by doing stuff (as opposed to by reading or listening to lectures), since even for the reading you have to complete a short quiz which helps you get a better idea of how to think about the material, and there are significant programming projects. I think it's a vast improvement on traditional computer networks courses since we weren't just reading 30-year-old RFCs for weeks on end, we were learning about relevant technologies today that we'll be working with when we enter the job force. The main drawback is that the teaching staff were pretty disorganized and it seemed like assignments were always getting thrown together right before we got them. This was the first offering of the revamped course though, so in future years it may be less of a logistical mess.","Hopefully, they will make this class better/organized in the future. Granted it was in its first stage of redevelopment, but it still felt too disorganized for a class. I loved that we got to interact with Dr. Kung and the teaching fellows who were amazing, responsive, accessible, and helpful. The class itself needs so much work especially in terms of material and assignments. I think more of programming assignments like the one given (there is only one), but shorter and more organized would be better than the quizzes (which need to be clearer and have a uniform answer key so we can study for quizzes). I felt like there was a lot expected out of us for the final project even though the fundamentals were not taught well at all. I understand the goal of this course, but it was honestly too ambitious and disorganized. I would not recommend taking the class until these issues are fully addressed.","I took this course because I wanted to fill a void in my knowledge regarding networks. While I did learn some from the course, I gained all that knowledge from textbook readings that I could have done on my own. I found it really hard to learn anything during lectures. HT Kung is brilliant but it is sometimes hard to understand what he is saying or how he is explaining concepts. That being said, the course is not very demanding. And it will give you motivation to read a textbook about networks. Also, some of the more modern things we talked about (e.g. vehicular networks) were pretty cool towards the end of the semester.","This class gave an interesting introduction to the field of computer networks. Do not expect to learn (much) implementation-level networking stuff though; you should view this class as research into what modern networks are like, and what opportunities/challenges exist in this realm. You will also have the opportunity to dive into one aspect of networks in a group final project of your own design. Overall I would say this is a unique type of CS course at Harvard that isn't for everyone, but could be, provided you go into the course with realistic expectations.","This class is a great introduction to networks, but Kung doesn't really speak English so he can't articulate much. He is great and seems to care about network but the language barrier is almost unbearable.","I would say if you're interested in the material, try to learn it yourself. This course is poorly structured and you'll end up learning very little of the material. Everything you learn is despite of how it's organized, not because of how it's organized. They through a ton of readings at you and you have to complete quizzes for every class (and you're given a very short amount of time to complete them). There's only one programming assignment in a semester and there's almost no assistance for doing it. It doesn't feel like a CS class at all, but like a poorly organized ged ed.","Lectures can be bad and they assign an overwhelming amount of readings sometimes, but the material is very good to know -- it fills a very big gap in most students' CS knowledge","The topics we go over in this class are actually quite relevant and interesting. Dr. Kung is a brilliant computer scientist and he knows so much about computer networks. However, the class itself was extremely unorganized. You could tell it was because the TFs took over 3 weeks to hand back quizzes, some were never returned, project instructions were given the week before, etc. You have to really read your textbook and the assigned papers if you want to learn anything (and believe me this stuff IS ACTUALLY RELEVANT despite what the class makes it seem like) or pass the quizzes / midterm. Make sure your final project is understandable and that you are making some real world application. My advice: instead of doing something that sounds complicated and involving gazillions of algorithms and protocols, do something simple that a normal, non-CS person would understand and use. (Think about how you'd apply network technologies in everyday life). Dr. Kung seems to like projects that serve a tangible purpose in the real world. Other than that, nothing was hard.",Great lectures and really interesting materials. Assignments and final project are a tad disorganized,"Kung is the man and the TFs were relatively accessible and helpful, but unfortunately the course, which was undergoing a ton of updates and changes to be fair, simply lacked focus and tried to teach way too much.  If they can narrow the scope of the class and have it organized better, I'd recommend it since some of the papers you read are very interesting and it definitely has some real value. Unfortunately, the course does have issues and is not a painless CS course.","Really interesting course. The format takes some getting used to though: don't expect much by way of course structure. Make sure to do the bi-weekly quizzes, it's a great way to get the material to stick.","This class was a mess. Dr. Kung's lectures were always well attended, but by students who were just on their phones or laptops all the time. The readings for this class were completely unnecessary. You can just google the midnight quiz questions. I didn't think it was possible, but this is a CS class that you can just basically BS your way through without having learned anything along the way (besides some networking buzzwords). In retrospect, this class is pretty easy (especially in terms of grading), but, if you actually want to know about networks, just cross-register at MIT instead.",This class has a ton of busy work when you aren't doing the programming assignment or project.,"If you are looking for a course with little work during the semester, then this class will probably be annoying but bearable. If your primary motive is something else (like learning about networking) you will likely be disappointed.","Computer networks are a very essential part of CS. Since there is currently no other good substitute for this class that teaches networks and distributed systems, this is a must take. The course could be more organized, but you pretty much get what you put into it.","Not very structured, but some interesting material","One of the worst courses I have taken at Harvard. The class is very poorly organized. Don't take it, unless new prof. teaches it. Cool material though.",Study day by day.,"It's a pretty boring course, you could just watch the videos that we have to watch and learn most important things. Not too much guidance is given during the final projects but you have to do 3 presentations? Overall, the work you put in is not worth what you get out.","Material is extremely interesting and grounded in current events. However, the lack of organisation is astonishing. It's impossible to plan ahead and a lot of things are made up on the fly, but definitely learned a ton and would recommend the class.","The quiz format/schedule was very annoying.  Did not get much out of lectures.  Overall, the class kind of felt like a mess."
COMPSCI 175: Computer Graphics,"Gortler is an extremely down-to-earth professor who cares deeply about his students' learning about the field of computer graphics. He's awesome! So's Yuanchen, for that matter.","This is a really great course that teaches you the basics of computer graphics. The problem sets are fun to do and don't take too much time and the material is very straightforward and easy to understand. If you are looking for a broad introduction to computer graphics and a course that isn't too time consuming, then this is the perfect class.","This class serves as a nice intro to and overview of the field of computer graphics, which you'll learn is very rich. There are a lot of potential careers involving graphics, and if you're interested in any of them, this is a good place to start. It's also a nice way to pick up some C++, which is pretty widely used in industry.",Take it if 3D modeling is relevant to any of your passions.,"If you want to get into the theory of computer graphics, and then have to deal with endless office hours to finish the psets, this is the class for you. If you want to actually be able to make cool graphics on the computer, do not take this class. By using the horrible language of C++ instead of graphics software, you will not be able to make anything that cool even by the time final projects roll around.","You'll probably enjoy it if you're into art and CS, or if you want to learn more about how your favorite games/digitally animated movies work. You might find it boring if you just randomly decide to sign up to fulfill the CS depth requirement.","If you find graphics interesting, you will like this course. If you don't, you won't. It will not challenge you too much, but you will learn.","A lot of math, most of the time being stuck on homework assignments came down to not getting the math right rather than coding problems. Gortler is an animated lecturer though, and a super chill dude.","Schlomo is amazing and runs very interesting lectures, but the PSets are slightly frustrating. It's a good introduction to OpenGL, but I don't know how much better this class is compared to an online tutorial. Given what I know now, I probably would have just taken another class. There are probably more interesting CS classes that you could take at Harvard.",I recommend this course to anyone who wants to be introduced in the fascinating field of Computer Graphics. The course will equip you with the necessary tools to continue on more advanced topics in CG.,"Honestly, it's kind of a bore. But it's low-stress. And the final project is open ended. And no exams.","If you're at all interested in computer graphics, consider taking this class. The lectures are often fairly dry and theoretical, but the problem sets are great and the TFs are super dedicated.","Learning C++ is great. The class itself is relatively straightforward, but I didn't come out of the class enthusiastic about computer graphics. Lectures weren't that effective for me, but sections/office hours are a MUST for your psets.",it's great! take it and i thought buying the book was helpful!,"If you're interested in computer graphics, this may be a good way to learn the fundamentals. However the lectures and material are not the most inspiring."
"COMPSCI 182: Intelligent Machines: Reasoning, Actions, and Plans",Interesting material and Prof Grosz is such a passionate teacher. :-) It's also not so difficult for a CS course.,"Decent class. The professor and the TFs care a lot and are pretty available. 

The lectures are difficult to stay present for the entire time. 

The midterms are pretty time-crunched.","If you thought CS 124 gave you a lot of computational ""tools"" to add to your computational ""toolbox,"" you should definitely see CS 182 as a course that will help you do the same! As an Applied Math - CS person, this was kind of a part 2 of CS 124 for me; a lot of algorithms that in 124 you see run in exponential time, you will explore better ways of improving those algorithms and tackling those problems in this class. The class was a bit of a reach for me in terms of difficulty, but if you're confident you can find a partner who will help you get through those bumps, you will grow a lot in this class!!","The first part of this class is what I had hoped CS124 to be. They take you through different algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, UCS, IDS, IDA* and make sure you can implement them. Then you get to learn some of the newer algorithms used in AI. These were explained pretty well and if not, material was available to us to learn them. The lectures were a bit too dry and theoretical in my opinion. The high point of lectures was when we actually got a chance to apply what we were learning and do practice problems in class. Prof. Grosz then walked us through the solution. I think more CS classes should try this out as this is what actually helps students learn more than lecturing. Fair warning about the class: after the first half, the class becomes pretty abstract and it is hard to see where the applications are. If you are looking to get into research, this would be a great class to take.","The material is fairly interesting, but be aware that it's somewhat of a hodgepodge/overview of the field. I'd recommend it to freshman and sophomores who want an overview of AI before taking more specific courses like CS181, CS187 etc. Don't be scared by the prerequisites, you don't need them in my view.",This is the most applicable CS class I took - I could really see how it relates to real world problems. It made for a fun and meaningful project as well. The course staff is so supporting and Prof. Grosz really cares about her students! Take it!,This is a great introduction to AI. The professor is a great lecturer. Sections are pretty helpful but not mandatory. Assignments are pretty fun.,"definitely not a grueling cs course, and you learn some interesting basic AI concepts. a lot of course materials are borrowed from the berkeley curriculum, which is pretty solid.",This was an amazing class--take it!,"This class is a great intro to AI. It delves into several different areas, with interesting discussions about the current state of AI. Coursework is very manageable, and assignments are actually fun to do.",You get to program Pacman!,"CS 182 is great class! I learned a lot about the theory and practice of AI, and enjoyed my experience the course. I think it is accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds and comfort with CS.","Reasonable workload, fun project. Don't expect to learn a ton of interesting theory though.","This is a terrific class! You learn a lot and you get to work on a great project! Professor Grosz made the class very interactive and tried hard to foster a sense of community. The class has a reasonable workload, and it is what you make of it in terms of how much you can learn. Great introduction to AI!","This course is pretty easy and not that challenging. The hardest part is dragging yourself to classes which move pretty slowly and don't let you use your laptop or do anything to break the monotony. That being said, Grosz is fantastically nice and the course staff genuinely care about the material.",This course is based on really interesting subject material and can be extended in a lot of interesting and cool ways. Being comfortable with Python will be helpful but not necessary when you are coming into the class.,Have a strong CS background because a lot of previous knowledge is assumed.,"While the ideas in this course are engaging and fascinating, especially for those interested in Artificial Intelligence, I found myself disappointed by the consistent lack of support and disorganization in this course. The problem sets were perhaps my favorite aspect of the course, and many of them were slight modifications of assignments from another intro to AI course. While the iSites had a page for assignment solutions, none were ever posted. Lectures and lecture notes were quite helpful in summarizing and as an overview of the material, but were never particularly engaging or exciting. Students were generally left to fill in the details through the readings, which was perfectly reasonable, but again quite dry. I would suggest that those who choose to take this course be certain they are interested enough in the material to engage themselves.","CS182 provides a great overview about Artificial Intelligence.  The teaching staff is great and the content is good.  On the other hand, the pacing of the course is a bit awkward and I do not agree with some of the course policies  (e.g. no laptops in class) but the teaching staff is receptive to ideas and I believe the course will improve overtime.","I don't understand why so many people told me this class was ""meh"" or ""bad"". I loved this class! If you think beyond what you're being told in lecture, the material can be applied to a huge variety of problems. For example, if you can turn your problem into a graph problem, you'll have a toolbox of algorithms to apply. If you figure out a function that tells you how ""good"" a given solution to your problem is, you'll have a bunch of algorithms for finding an optimal solution.  I directly used some material from this class on interviews I had for software positions as well.

The only part that was difficult to apply was First Order Logic, but most of the other material was very useful. I'd definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in efficient and applicable problem solving techniques. If you're looking for lots of theory and proofs of algorithms, however, then this isn't the class for you.

The guest lectures are great.

Also, I'm pretty sure you don't need CS 121 (I didn't take it, and many others didn't when we had a class survey). I don't recall having to prove anything by induction in this class. The only CS 121 material we really used was logic (I think that's covered in CS 121 or CS 20?), but it's not too difficult to pick up if you go to office hours or spend some time self-studying it. The CS 20 textbook (it's free, just look at CS 20's website) covers the basics pretty well.

The final project is fun. Just give your group time to finish it and DO NOT try to do it all in a couple of days. The writeup matters as much as if not more than your implementation. Make sure you spend time on it and read it over so it makes perfect sense.","Not sure why this class has historically gotten mediocre Q-reviews. It is organized, not crazy in terms of workload, and the material is very interesting and relevant. Would especially recommend taking this as one of the CS electives. Also, Ofra is an awesome TF!","Very interesting course with a great lecturer (Gosz) and a very helpful and engaged teaching staff. The course is not too difficult but some of the assignments can take a long time to finish. In any case, a great course that include many important and interesting topics from introductory artificial intelligence.","I decided to take this course because AI seems like a really interesting topic. When you complete the course you'll probably find AI to be fairly tedious and realize that most of the solutions we have so far aren't particularly good. The course is taught pretty well, but the material just isn't that interesting, so I can't recommend this class highly."
COMPSCI 187: Computational Linguistics,"got to learn pretty cool stuff on natural language processing (NLP)! very manageable in terms of difficulty level, while you sitll get exposed to new things. lectures can be slow and soporific at times but the material is interesting. workload in the last month has a sharp increase comparing to previous ones, so be prepared -- it started off easy but suddenly has many deadlines jammed together toward the end. overall, worth to take if you want to learn NLP.","I am a linguistics concentrator, and I enjoyed this class. It was a good introduction to computational linguistics, and though I have a bunch of quibbles about the field in general (most relating to a generally hand-wavy cop-out attitude toward actual linguistics), it is really interesting. I was also happy for the chance to actually learn Python. If you study linguistics and have some programming experience, try it out: people will defer to your opinion on language matters, and come to you with questions about parts of speech and stuff. It's fun. 

On a logistic note, Prof. Shieber is generally pretty entertaining; the lectures are good if you pay attention; the problem sets are interesting and stimulating; and though the course had major organizational issues this year, I think we students raised enough of a kerfuffle that they'll be worked out in the future. 

(Just in case, these were the issues: 1. Easy problem sets at the beginning that get very hard toward the end; 2. Final project waypoint deadlines interspersed with difficult problem set deadlines, making it difficult to do either as well as one would like; 3. A number of F.A.S. rule violations, including lectures during reading period and assignment due-dates during reading period.)","This was a good course, especially early. You learn about textual analysis in terms of statistical methods and logical/grammar-based methods. This year, there were 4 problem sets plus multiple final project deadlines in late November / early December, which was really hectic.",This is a great class and Professor Shieber is really nice and on your side! Please get to know him better! He is really cool and the material is awesome!,"I really, really wish I could recommend CS187.  The material is engaging, the problem sets are interesting and useful, and the entire teaching staff seems genuinely dedicated to fostering our understanding of computational linguistics.

The problem is that the logistics were just a complete, utter mess.  I know Professor Shieber has taught this class before, so I don't understand how he overestimated the amount of material he could cover in a semester to such a degree.  There were far too many assignments, which increased sharply in length and complexity in the last month or so - just when we also were starting on final projects.  He also tried some odd things like an assigned partner pset, a hybrid group-individual structure for the final project, and a writing practicum aspect to the project, none of which, I suspect, worked out quite as he had envisioned.","This is really interesting material, however be very wary of the class organization. Lectures can be dry at times and not that great at actually teaching the concepts, so often it's better to read the textbook/course notes (which often don't cover everything that's said in class). Unless the course format changes in future years, be prepared to be inundated with work towards the end of the semester, even during reading period, so make sure to account for course work.","Take this class if you are curious about NLP and have a high threshold for pain and painstaking things. The assignments do go in depth and provide intellectual challenge as the semester progresses. Lectures also get much better when programming in Prolog section starts. However, there may be just 1 or 2 too many assignments, as there's something due every week, for a total of 10 assignments in the semester, along with your concurrently running final project starting in November. So look before you enroll in this class.","The material in this course is interesting. Shieber is extremely passionate and that definitely shines through. That said, the material later in the course is considerably more difficult and so students struggling with earlier problem sets should consider dropping the class. In fall 2014, the new final project format meant that there were many weeks with problem sets and final project components due; this made for a very stressful end of the semester.","This class ruined my semester. From blatantly disregarding FAS course policies (we had class during reading period as well as project deadlines through reading period and through the second to last day of finals period) to the passive aggressiveness of instructor responses on piazza and the low quality lectures (many students chose not to attend, and out of the group that did, there was always one napper and occasionally a student who obviously wasn't paying attention, and, for example, doing origami instead), this course was disastrous. Though I had misgivings, the course material interested me enough that I stayed through the 5th week, which is about when everything went down the drain. The problem set difficulty increased exponentially while the lectures became way less helpful and way more boring. If you are able to focus on Professor Shieber's conversational and winding lecture style, then this class may be bearable for you. The course staff did not seem very interested in actually helping us, and most Piazza answers completely avoided the question at hand, and instead adopted a chastising tone and redirected the student to course notes, or the assignment instructions.","You'll definitely learn some cool material. For example, suppose you had a bunch of sentences with the spaces removed, in a language you were completely unfamiliar with. What algorithm would you use to determine where the word breaks are?

Having said this, I think it's important to note that Shieber is, much more so than any professor I have encountered, very focused on presentation. As a result, you'll spend a lot of time proofreading (code, problem set writeups, final project writeup). This is exacerbated by the grading scale (1-5). Basically if you make no mistakes you get a 5, and if you make even a small mistake you'll get knocked down to a 4. This necessitates a ton of proofreading, which I didn't feel was very valuable.","The material is fairly interesting, but ends up being a little too specific/niche for me. Computational linguistics is one of those problems that's sort of impossible to fully solve, so most algorithms/techniques are heuristics or approximations, which is a little unsatisfying.

Also, the workload of this class really ramps up at the end, where we had 2 psets and the final project all due within a span of about 2 weeks. Also, a lot of the work is silly stuff like writing a specifically formatted documentation string for every function in your code, or spending a lot of extra time because the pset specification is unclear or vague. For some reason, it seems that the only responses the course staff are allowed to give on Piazza are quoting the specification, or ""it's up to you"" (which isn't actually true, grade-wise). This is a shame because a lot of people have very legitimate questions that probably would benefit from an actual answer.
Also, the final projects are chosen for you (there's a set of N projects and you rank them and get put on one) and most aren't particularly interesting. The end of the class really becomes kind of a drag.

Even despite all this, I'd probably still take the course—it's an interesting subtopic of CS that likely has applications in a lot of other fields. Hopefully one day machines will be able to understand standard English/other languages. But there are probably better courses to take if you have a packed schedule already.","I'm not sure if the field of computational linguistics is just not for me, but this course wasn't what I expected. I'm not entirely sure I can even say now what I've learned in this course or what computational linguistics even is, but apparently I was able to get through the psets (which were still a fair amount of work). Prof Shieber is really nice and most likely has done brilliant research, but is not the most organized or engaging lecturer. There's also too much expectation that you will read the textbook on your own (and lectures as I mentioned are not particularly helpful). You do get to learn Prolog, which is a really interesting language to program in (and I'd recommend checking it out even if you don't take this class)","This is class that I really wanted to like.  The material is pretty interesting and Prof Shieber is a great guy.  However, there are some fundamental problems in the architecting in the course.  Problem sets are very easy at the beginning of the semester but then become basically impossible toward the end.  In addition, while these psets are becoming impossible, a six-stage final project appears.  Furthermore, Prof Shieber expected us to attend class through reading period.  The class needs to be fundamentally restructured in its pacing","The material is very interesting. The first part of the course has a lot of machine learning, and the second part transitions from Python to Prolog and makes greater use of structure and semantics. The course gets significantly harder towards the end of the semester. Project and homework deadlines overlap as the assignments get more difficult.","Very interesting material that is also very well-taught. NLP is a fascinating subject area, and you'll learn a lot of the fundamental techniques in this course. However, the course sometimes (particularly toward the end of the semester) scrunches together deadlines, which makes assignments hectic/stressful; hopefully that can be improved in future iterations.","Very good course overall. Some lectures are pretty slow, but then other lectures are pretty confusing and could be slowed down. So I think if the teaching staff does a little better job of balancing the course it could be made better. However, I didn't actually have too many complaints about this and enjoyed the material and psets. Staff is very nice.","Do not take this course unless they change the workload. Or if you're obsessed with natural language processing. I took it because I like most artificial intelligence classes, and I took it for fun. 
There were assignments every week, which were difficult but doable when they only took 10-15 hours. But then they started becoming more unreasonable, requiring more like 30 hours and unimaginable frustration, on behalf of most people in the class. (I know I am not an anomaly). There were only 2 hours of office hours a week, though the tfs were pretty open to helping if you asked. 

This is what I wrote to the instructors:

The course needs to reduce the amount it teaches. We should not be required to attend class during reading period just to fit in more content that the professor wants to cover. We should not be required to complete assignments (that take 30 hours or more) while we are working on the final project. Assignments should be finished if there is going to be a final project. Further, the last four assignments should have two weeks in between them, rather than one, in order to get them done reasonably. This was the only class I did significant work for, and I still couldn't fit all the work in when working on it full time. There should be more than 2 hours of office hours a week."
COMPSCI 189r: Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems,"The idea of this course is wonderful, but its strengths are marred significantly by how horrible the robots used in the class are to work with. The course work always became less about implementing solutions for the psets, and more about finding ways to work around the horrible hardware to get the robot to do something along the lines of what you want it to do. I would have reservations about taking this class if I were you, and they still plan on offering the course without getting new ePucks, or different robots.","You'll get tired of the E-pucks, but this class is mostly a lot of fun. I especially enjoyed coming up with hacks to reduce the complexity of the robot's tasks each week. Try to take this class with a friend you know you can work well with.","There are a couple interesting problem sets, but you might not learn as much as you hope about multi-robot systems. 80% of the class hardly mentioned multi-robot systems, and the last 20% only touched on it, but the final project was basically programming a single robot multiple times. Programming the robots was often tedious and frustrating for several reasons (e.g. slow debugging, hardware issues, and your ambition is limited by the memory and computing capability of the hardware). Don't expect to program any super sophisticated algorithms on the robots; it probably won't work, but even if it is possible, you will encounter annoying bugs long before you get to such advanced optimization.",The class offers the opportunity to experience the highs and lows of developing programming for a robotic platform.,"The class is really fun in terms of getting robots to do things, but ePucks are kind of terrible. Its a great class if like project-oriented classes with open-ended challenges.","Great intro to robotics. They cover a wide range of topics and you learn a lot. It's also cool to watch your robot in action.

My only reservation is that working on the problem sets can be very frustrating because you spend the majority of your time working on calibration or hardware issues."
COMPSCI 207: Systems Development for Computational Science,"Coming in as a physics concentrator, this was the first CS class I've taken that has been directly relevant to my field, and yet was still accessible outside of it. It wasn't an overly difficult course, Cecka was a great lecturer, and the psets were all very interesting. I honestly think that it made me a better programmer, and the tricks I learned with C++ were amazing. I would recommend this course to anyone, physics or not, though I would say that it makes life a little easier with a background in C (which most undergrads here would have anyway).",This is a good class if you want to learn about C++. You'll learn a lot about C++ abstraction and do amazing things with them.,"This is a very useful course, but you MUST have some previous experience with C++. This was actually my third attempt to take the course. The first time I realized after the first lecture that I wasn't ready, having only done Python and very basic C before. I did some preparation and tried to take it again the following year. I struggled with the first problem set, but got through it. Then I read the 2nd problem set and dropped the course. I then worked on a code base in C++ and picked up a lot of the basics before trying again. I finally felt prepared, and while it was still challenging, I learned a ton and it was very rewarding. 3rd time's the charm, as they say.",Need to take some c++ before taking this class.,"This class will make you a C++ god, and you will build really awesome projects. Be prepared to put a ton of time into it though. Also Cris is a fantastic teacher. He's incredibly passionate about coding well, and very funny.",Its kind of a lot of work. Sometimes tedious. Lectures not always relevant to class work.,"This class is amazing.  Cris is wonderful.  That said this course is HARD: some psets will absolutely own your life, and the midterm was insanely tough. Having experience with systems and algorithms definitely a must and having C++ experience makes it a lot better.  You will vastly improve as a programmer after taking this course.  Hopefully Cris keeps teaching it: he is amazing.",Great class to improve C++ skill. The materials taught in this class are very specific to C++.,"Make sure you have very good background in C++ and algorithms and data structures, or else you will suffer a lot",But come prepared.,"This class is incredibly challenging, and will likely be very different without Cris teaching it next year, but I found it to be one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Harvard. I recommend that any CS concentrator who wants to learn how to write production code and fundamentals of software design take this class as early as possible.","CS 207 with Cris was awesome. It's a chance to focus a semester on developing your software engineering skills, which will go a long way in my opinion. The highlight for me was the problem sets, which begin with a lot of starter code and gradually wean you off so you are designing large portions on your own. The theme of the problem sets is a graph class which gets used to model water flow, rubber cloths, and a Poisson equation solver. If the same problem sets are kept next year, I would highly recommend 207, but unfortunately Cris is leaving so the course will be a bit different.","Take this course if you want to learn more systems programming after CS61, if you want to learn C++, or if you just want a good course in general!  Cecka is a great professor and lecturer, and this class will force you to not only become acquainted with high (low) level concepts, but also force good programming habits on you.","Definitely kept my programming sword sharpened. I actually enjoyed most of the course, and the visualizations that resulted from our code were a great way to feel extra satisfied with yourself. That being said, I felt that a lot of the course was quite ""fluffy"", and much of the thinking that went into design patterns, loop invariants, representation functions, and abstraction functions seemed unnecessary to me. Maybe I'm just too inexperienced, but damn I was bored.","I may never have taken this class were it not a requirement for my S.M. program. That would have been a shame, as it turned out to be the most useful and engaging class I have taken at Harvard so far. This course teaches very useful software engineering and computer science fundamentals that make you think very critically about the code you write.",Hard C++ course with design focus,"This class takes a lot of time, make sure you have that time."
COMPSCI 224: Advanced Algorithms,Amazing class that was tough but rewarding. Would highly recommend for anyone with sufficient math background.,"We learned about lots of interesting algorithms, especially linear programming.","I enjoyed the class as an overview to advanced algorithm. Prof. Nelson gives a clear, in-depth explanation of the topic and the lectures gave me a good grasp of most of the topic discussed. This year, the problem sets weren't great though I assume they will be redesigned in future iterations as I believe they were newly created for this year's course. There is a final project at the end, for which there really isn't that much time, since there's problem sets until two weeks before reading period. Overall, I'd recommend the class, especially if the last few rough edges can be worked out.",It is a good course to get to know a wide range of works in theoretical computer science related to algorithm design.,"This is a challenging class. If you love algorithms and did well in CS124 it's a good logical next step. Keep in mind that these will much more abstract and you won't be actually implementing these algorithms as you might in CS124. But it's fascinating material and you learn about some pretty recent research that's being done in algorithms. If there's any change you'd consider doing research in algorithms, definitely take this course!","It takes a lot of time but you learn many new and interesting things. But if you are that much not into algorithms, better not take this class. If you are into algorithms, then with no doubt enroll in this class.","Material was very interesting, but problem sets were very difficult.",Very enjoyable and useful if you intend to study or apply state of the art algorithms.,"This class is generally taught pretty well. The problem sets tend to relate to problems solved in papers somewhat recently, but Jelani provides enough hints that they're pretty reasonable.

For those who were interested in CS124, the main difference (apart from the fact that the material is more advanced) is the lack of coding assignments."
COMPSCI 227r: Topics in Cryptography and Privacy,Put in the time; see what the specific topic is.,Mark,"The class material is definitely difficult, so please don't be hesitate to ask questions during lectures and during Office Hours."
COMPSCI 250: Software Foundations,"I would emphatically recommend this course to anyone who studies theoretical computer science or even mathematics.  In broad terms, the course explores constructing a logic system and how a computer can determine something is correct.","This is a pretty specialized course. If you're interested in PL you'll get a lot out of it. Also worth looking at if you're CS/Math, though the proofs we were writing were mostly about programming languages (not, for instance, group theory). Greg is a really engaging professor, so if the topic piques your interest then I highly recommend it.","This course was absolutely amazing. Listening to Greg lecture is always very fun and interesting. All the assignments were very rewarding and entertaining to complete. Using formal methods is a very tedious job, one that I may never do again, but it was fascinating to touch the surface of for a semester. If you are a computer scientist and like proofs, take this class!",be prepared to do some serious self study and make sure you are mathematically prepared to take this class,"It's a cool class where you learn a lot in lecture, but the homework assignments take a long time, are difficult, and unrewarding. Morrisett is a good lecturer who knows his stuff. You get to work alongside a lot of graduate students which is pretty neat, so you get to see a glimpse of academic life is like at Harvard if you're an undergrad.","This year was the first iterations of the course, so obviously there were rough edges. I thought the focus of the course was slightly too heavy on case studies (and the actual theory being implemented) which would also be covered in another class on that topic as opposed to modeling them and proving things about them. Nevertheless, I found the class educational and would recommend it.","This class is fun and interesting, and I appreciated how hard Professor Morrisett worked to make it accessible to us undergraduates.  The assignments were challenging, but the teaching staff answered Piazza questions promptly and helpfully, and we sometimes went over aspects of the homework in class, not to mention Professor Morrisett was pretty flexible with deadlines depending on how much we were struggling.

The one complaint I have is that we got little feedback on the work we turned in.  This wasn't actually that big of a deal because it isn't like there's a way to get an automated proof ""wrong"" once it's been completed, but it was still mildly annoying we didn't get back grades for the first pset until we had turned in the fourth, and at least for me, the feedback consisted of a letter grade and a one-line comment.","Pretty good class, especially for a first-time class with no clear predecessor. As structured in this semester, the class really focuses on Coq. It can be a little discouraging to see that one needs to slog through a lot just to get something simple proven, but by and large the experience is instructive.",Take it because Morrisett is awesome and so is David Darais,"This class is really awesome. It's unclear how viable formal verification languages like Coq are for doing anything useful (as you'll soon find out if you do take the class), but they're kinda fun, and the motivation for them is certainly clear (no more Heartbleeds).

The workload comes in spurts—for weeks you won't do anything for the class and then you'll spend hours on hours trying to prove something that probably looks obviously true. Probably my lowest workload class overall this semester, though, and a really fun experience.","Especially for something in its first year, CS250 was a fantastic course.  Prof Morrisett's notes were comprehensive and easy to follow.  Know what you're getting yourself into: the class can be extremely frustrating and challenging at times, and support from the TF this semester was nearly nonexistent.  There is a steep learning curve to climb, and really being interested in this kind of stuff helps.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone whose curiosity is piqued by the material.","As every new course, this one certainly did have some rough edges. That being said, it was a wonderful journey that I would retake any time."
COMPSCI 252r: Advanced Topics in Programming Languages
COMPSCI 261: Research Topics in Operating Systems,This is an awesome class and knowledge gained from the class brings you to a whole new level of understanding about computing.,"I don't think Margo knows how to make an easy course—this one is easier than 161 but still very tough. There's two ~12 page conference papers (about 25 pages as a double-spaced Word document) to read every class, which does get tiring. Most of the papers are very good though, and you'll learn lots of the hip systems research topics and where they are now. You'll also learn to examine research papers critically, take away the big ideas, and see the connections between various different research topics.

Then you'll do your own research project, in addition to the readings. This project is really what you make of it, but if you want to have a good project you'll have to put in a lot of time here. Interestingly, what code you write is not so important here—it's all about the writing and presentation of the results (you'll likely have to write code to get results, though!).

Overall, this is a great course and will really help you get acquainted with the state of systems research. If you're at all interested/intrigued by systems, research, and have room in your schedule, it's definitely worth taking this class.",You really have to spend time on it and pay effort. This is the only that the course helps you improve.
COMPSCI 265: Big Data Systems,Excellent course on big data systems. Not just an ordinary database systems course. I learned many fundamental issues that are associated with managing big data platforms and came out with a better understanding of the research and work that is being done in this area,"One of the most interesting classes I've ever taken! Lectures are really just round-table discussions on papers, and always fascinating. Take this class even if you don't have any prior database experience (I didn't, and still got a lot out of the class)","This class was phenomenal with Stratos and Manos. They generated a real enthusiasm for topics in database research and structured the class in a very student friendly manner. Definitely one of the most interesting CS classes I've gotten to take. Overall, it will be up to you as far as how much you get out of the course, but it is possible to learn/do a lot.",If you are interested in research or more specifically data systems research-- take this class. Stratos is extremely caring of his students and this class will help you to transition into real research work.,Stratos is really passionate about data systems and spend a lot of time and energy on this course. This is a great class if you are interested in data systems research. It will cover enough breath and depth on most of the new topics and you'll get to interact with visiting scholars.,solid systems background recommended to understand the research papers. be prepared for the backgrounds of students in the class to be highly varied.,"TAKE THIS CLASS! I got in the class after having taken CS165 last semester so I had some good exposure to basic database concepts, how column stores work and had read some papers in the field. Throughout the class I learned SO MUCH MORE about big data systems, databases made by Google, Facebook, IBM, about database models, techniques, data analysis, current research topics and also how to think and talk about data processing/storing issues. So, yes, I learned a ton and on top of that got to meet really cool people. Everyone taking the class is really smart and contributed to really cool conversations in class. Also, Professor Idreos and Manos are very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and overall amazing in stirring the conversations to the right places and being inspiring when it comes to actually doing research. And that is the best part of the class. You get to work on your own research project with Professor Idreos about really cool database topics and Stratos is a great advisor. He really manages to keep you motivated, encouraged and help you learn how to go about coming up with your own ideas and explore them. Also, last but not least we had some amazing speakers in the class, including the founder of MemSQL, C. Mohan from IBM research as well as two researchers from HP Labs. That is particularly inspiring because you really get to see what cool computer scientists are doing in industry!!! Need I say more? TAKE CS265 and also take CS165 with Stratos if you have a chance!","Great course, Stratos is a great professor and leads this coure really well!  Highly recommend","For undergrads, this is the continuation of CS165. If you are a CS concentrator considering CS research or CS grad school, this class would be useful. Otherwise you should be highly motivated to learn about current trends in database architectures and design. As the first iteration of this class, this year was quite structure free. Be prepared to discuss about a lot of open-ended questions during class. It is quite beautiful as you can see certain themes and big questions reoccur again even as each class discussion is on a set of different academic data systems papers. For your ongoing final project, be ambitious and swing for the fences on some of these open problems, and dare to solve them!",This course won't kill you if you have a full schedule but the more time you invest the more you will get out of it.,"I came from HKS to take this class, so it was very difficult for me to keep up as a non-computer scientist. But I am very glad I tried! The material was eye-opening and the instructors simply excellent."
COMPSCI 279: Research Topics in Human-Computer Interaction,"This class consists of reading and discussing human-computer interaction papers in addition conducting original research as the final project. You'll have the chance to talk about HCI for three hours a week and will learn a lot about the field, and it's great to have a chance to talk about design and technology in a seminar setting. Prof Gajos is very knowledgeable and does a great job leading the discussion. I'd highly recommend the class to anyone interested in the topic of the class or HCI in general.","I absolutely loved this course. It truly helped me understand the literature better and grow as an HCI researcher. There are so many interesting projects and works in the field. The workload is pretty manageable overall, but the projects take a bit of time.",This is a great class if you want to get an exposure to various research topics in HCI.,"Absolutely fantastic class that will expose you to exciting HCI research and core HCI principles. A lot of work, especially toward the end of the semester with final projects, but a lot of fun with a lot to learn. The laid-back but insightful discussions really make the class."
COMPSCI 283: Computer Vision,"This is an incredibly worthwhile class that exposes you to a breadth of image processing and computer vision algorithms. However, it isn't something to be underestimated. It's a tough class, but it thoroughly doable if you leverage office hours and collaborate with your peers.",Prof. Zickler's lectures are very well-presented and engaging,"Make sure you have a decent linear algebra background (or if it's been a while since you've taken linear algebra, review the concepts) before taking the class! I hadn't taken linear algebra for several years, so I struggled many times in class because linear algebra concepts are essential to many of the algorithms and concepts in computer vision.

I thought this class was a great overview of the fundamental concepts and algorithms in computer vision, so definitely take it if you're interested in that field- there are many exciting applications! Zickler is a great lecturer and tries to give an intuitive understanding of the material, but he's not very available outside of class (he says he only eats in undergrad dining halls once a year maybe). The TF's were helpful at office hours but very slow to answer questions on Piazza.","While computer vision sounds like a fascinating field, this class doesn't really demonstrate it that well. The lectures were on seemingly unrelated topics every week, and nothing seemed to connect together on a higher level. Also, I learned that Matlab is not very fun to code with.",A very excellent and relatively easy class. You'll be exposed to many ideas and can get really creative with your final project,Interesting material and clear lectures. Professor Zickler is awesome. Don't miss out on this class -- it is worth it. It is quite manageable and you will learn so much.,Great course!,Great class but a lot of work.,"It is challenging to fully, completely understand all the linear algebra behind the more complex algorithms and it's sometimes difficult to wrap your mind around the projective geometry. However, Professor Zickler is a fantastic teacher and makes it more intuitive and fun to learn. The problem sets and final project are extremely rewarding as you get to see the power of the algorithms you learn in class as you apply them to real problems. One of my friends said it very well: ""The density of moments in this class that make you say 'Wow. I never thought about the world that way before.' is very high"". If you put enough effort into this class to try to understand the material as well as possible, you will be very glad you did.",Good first grad course as it's basically like an undergrad course with psets (in MATLAB sadly).,"This was a fantastic course. Extremely well taught, fun assignments, etc. Just be aware that problem sets were due on Mondays, generally eating up weekend days one might rather spend doing other things.",I like the assignments. They enhance my knowledge learned from the class and they are so interesting.,"Excellent Course!  Professor Zickler is a great lecturer and definitely is enthusiastic about the subject.  You will learn a lot in the class.  Make sure however that you understand linear algebra well, or otherwise you will get lost in this class very quickly.",This is a really cool course,"If you are at all interested in how 2-D images are created from the 3-D world and what you can do with these images, definitely take this class! There are so many interesting topics that I learned throughout the course, starting with projective geometry and homographies and ending with classifiers and face detection. This area of computer science is very exciting as new technologies are being invented.

There were 8 problem sets and 1 midterm and 1 final project. Each problem set had a mixture of coding and mathematical proofs, and the midterm was pretty comprehensive as it was held in mid November. The final project is an individual project and is pretty rewarding, as there are so many different topics to branch out to."
COMPSCI 284r: Topics on Computation in Networks and Crowds,Good course to take to get a feel of what's the current areas of graph algorithms and research are,"What you get out of this class really depends on your interest in the material and how much work you want to invest. I was not interested in many of the papers we read for each class, so did not get much out of most classes. Yaron seemed to pick papers based on what he wanted an excuse to read, rather than what he thought would be best for students to learn about. Nor did he try to generate enthusiasm among the students. So while I learned a lot from a few of the papers, I felt that most of my time in this course could have been better spent elsewhere.","The course covers very interesting material! Assignments and projects can be somewhat disorganized, but all in all if you're interested in the subject matter you'll find it rewarding."
"ENG-SCI 21: The Innovator's Practice: Finding, building and leading good ideas with others","This is a great class that I think everyone should take if only to learn the human centered design process. The class is quite unstructured and so you'll need to be motivated as a team in order to produce excellent outputs. A lot of this experience will depend on the team cause you will spend all of your time with them. You can't choose a team, but know that you're grouped based on interest so take the survey seriously. Other than that, put in the time and effort, and you'll end up with something you can take to the iLab!",waste of my elective and time. startup class takes ridiculous amounts of time. you do not get to choose your team.,This course is one of the kind. It's a really unique opportunity and I would really recommend taking it. You get to work on an interesting project with people from different schools and learn a ton about working with other people. I wish Harvard had more opportunities to get immersed into a team project like that. The professor is a great resource and the material she's teaching is very relevant.,Take it if you are good at designing or want to learn how to work with teams. If you hate grop projects don't take it,Not all students like the class's lack of structure,"Amazingly instructed by Beth, a class which teaches you small-team innovation methods",Exciting and different class that challenges you in other ways than most other classes at university.,"The course itself was a great opportunity to learn through experience the different practices and processes associated with innovation and the development of an original product. It's framed very well, in a way that introduces students to some of the psychology, sociology, and business principles connected to team work and innovation while they themselves conduct research, solve problems, and develop solutions in teams.",If you're interested in entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship this course is for you. Rather than just learn about what it is it challenges you to tackle an existent problem and work through solving it from field-work to prototyping. You may very likely begin a startup out of this course as many of my peers plan on doing. I enjoyed this course very much and it seemed like all of my peers did too.,Take this course if you want general exposure and a manageable workload class.,"Depending on your group, you might get pretty far along on a compnay/venture. However, if you do not click with your group, there is a lot to be learned from working and creating a synergetic team environment with many odds agains you."
ENG-SCI 27: Design By Committee. Digital Interfaces for Collaborative and Participatory Design
ENG-SCI 29: Introduction to Computational Design,"Although the course is for students without any pre-knowledge in coding, it defintely help to have some."
ENG-SCI 50: Introduction to Electrical Engineering,This class is a great intro for Electrical Engineering. The final project is really fun and you get to make something cool. I would recommend for people interested in any engineering field.,"As far as SPU goes, this is not your typical ""gem"" option. That being said, it is probably among the most interesting. Lab is admittedly incredibly frustrating, but this class gave me a real world understanding of so many technologies. The final project is also a really cool opportunity to build something awesome, although beware that it takes a lot of time and the material learned in class doesnt actually fully prepare you. I am glad I took this class because it was always something that I thought I would be interested in. Marko and Chris also love teaching, which is great.","The first half on circuits is the toughest part; if you have some CS background, the last half on digital systems will be pretty easy.",Would recommend to students genuinely interested in hardware.  Was a fairly significant amount of work for an elective class.  Any background in E&M is beneficial but not necessary.,"First thing: Marko and Chris are both great professors who are amazingly invested in the course and the students, and they really looked like they wanted to make it accessible to everyone. That said, there were times where the psets and labs were ambiguous, and were difficult to complete not because they were inherently difficult, but because they were unclear. As someone with a bit of a science and CS background, it was simple enough to follow the topics, but that is despite the fact that they were not taught in the most accessible way. Still, given enough effort, I think most people succeed in it, and it never hurts to learn how to do some basic (yet cool!) EE stuff.",Absolutely amazing. Dont graduate without taking this course,Take this course. It's a lot of fun.,It's not the most rigorous class.,You won't learn how to actually build much until you do the final project,The final project is so much fun! The labs are sometimes frustrating.,"ES50 is a great introduction to circuits and electrical engineering. Unless you are genuinely interested in electrical engineering you will probably be tempted to slack off, but even then you will come away with somewhat of a better understanding of how electronics work. I didn't enjoy lecture and thought the course materials (basically the lecture slides) were hard to sift through, but psets and labs help you learn the material.",Fun and easy although more work then i expected,It's a very good introduction to electrical engineering.,"This is a great class to fulfill your Gen Ed requirement. The labs can be both frustrating and enjoyable, the homework is relatively easy with ample opportunity for extra credit, and the final project is truly an awesome experience to practically do something in the field that entices you. I felt the course to be very generous when it came to grading, but like I said above, there is often some frustration with a lack of understanding of labs and certain homework problems -- but in the greater (grade) scheme of things, this does not matter.","ES50 tries to cover an ambitious number of topics in a short amount of time. ES50 assumes that you don't know enough about math and physics to really go into depth about a lot of topics, until Chris teaches about transistors in last few lectures. This is great class  if you're interested in any easy, fun way to fulfill the science of the physical universe requirement, but if you want a serious introduction to electrical engineering, I would recommend ES 153 (Physics 123) if you care at all about physics, or ES 52 otherwise. That said, the labs and final project are a lot of fun. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on your final project during reading period!",You have to make it to the end to get the true enjoyment of the course. The final project is the best part.,"This is an ""easy"" class, but you'll still do a fair amount of work.  My favorite and least favorite part of the class was the final project: I really bonded with my group and made friends with a lot of other people in the class during our mutual struggle for hours in the lab during reading period.  Marko was in the lab at 11 on a Saturday night helping us out, and he even brought us doughnuts, which is so awesome of him.  However, the project did take up ALL of my time.  It was a really rewarding experience in the end, and I feel like I got a lot out of it.  If I had the choice, I would definitely take this class again.  Also, fun fact, there are a lot more guys than girls in this class.","I lucked out with having people to do PSETS with who either had some CS or Physics background (that I didn't). But, I'm glad I took it!!",The class is super fun if you're interesting in learning how things work and other electrical stuff... Lectures are fun and really interesting. the Quiz is hard but totally doable if you're on top of practice problems and problem sets.,"The project component of the class was the best part. The lectures are kind of bland, and they could be improved with some demonstrations. Lectures are also an hour and a half, which are too long in my opinion for the material covered. Feedback on assignments in the course is not very consistent. The professors care a lot about the students though, and overall it was pretty painless.","A good way to satisfy SPU. It was more work than I anticipated, but worth it. The material is interesting. Most of the Ifs are really engaged with the material and willing to put in a lot of time to help you with whatever you need. The final project is a good experience - it's pretty cool what people can put together. And Professor Loncar is fantastic.","This is a great course! TFs are really helpful and try their best to make you succeed. Marko is an incredible professor and will take a lot of time and energy to help you. Make sure you pay attention in lecture, as some of the material can be tough at first, but nothing is obscenely hard, and the TFs and professors will always be around to help.",Really cool to learn about how everyday stuff works. Lecture is bleh.,"Basic knowledge of coding is helpful, especially for final projects.",Fun class! Can be a lot of work and can be VERY disorganized.,ES50 is great mostly because you get to build a ridiculously fun final project in the end. You can survive the course without actually going to lecture but they are really interesting when you do go and you get to build pretty fun things in lab. I think it's a great class to take as an elective if you want to do more hands on things.,You will not believe how much you have learned by the time you finish this class. I am still amazed that I was actually able to think of and build my project.,"You do learn a lot about the course - labs are fun, the final project is rewarding, and there isn't that much work compared to other courses. However, there can be a lot of disorganization, lack of help, and confusion sometimes. The class has great potential - it just needs to be more supportive to students (in terms of materials and questions) and organized (duedates, psets, etc). There were definitely times when I got a lot of help, especially after getting closer to TFs, but especially at the beginning as a freshmen, it was tough. Aside from some rough patches though, you learn a lot of electronics and I am consider going into EE after this - so there was definitely some effect.","ES50 is fun and interesting. It is definitely work intensive however. I took the course because I was interested in learning how electronics work and get an intro into building a device through the final project. I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. Despite the long hours in lab, working on psets, and building my final project, I learned a lot and got a taste of engineering. It's a fun SPU and well worth it for those who like science/physics/math. I recommend it!","Until the lab component is fixed and the professors begin to realize much more organization is involved in running a course that's so large, I am unlikely to recommend this course. Formal labs should have ended much earlier to allow us extra time on the final project. Labs are absolutely terrible: long, confusing, and often, dysfunctional.",Very hard but very rewarding. the final project is a lot of fun,The course gives a great introduction to electrical engineering!,If you are even thinking about engineering you should take it!,"ES50 is a very practical course; half the things you learn will be like puzzle-solving (op amps, for example), and half the things you learn will seem like either CS50 or a harmonics lesson in physics. Be aware that while there's a lot of guidance for the psets and assignments and usually TFs are amazing during lab, it's sometimes disorganized (for instance, the date of the final project fair changed a couple weeks before the end of the semester, and the nature of the fair was pretty unclear to us until very close to the date). Additionally, you have to really ask for help for the final project if you don't know what you're doing, so that's also difficult. Overall, would take again, but be a lot more proactive (annoying?) in getting help.","If you are interested in the material and want to walk away with some tangible skills while picking up a Gen Ed credit, then this is the class for you. It will require you to put in some effort, but you are able to reap the rewards of your labor. There are bonus points on the psets, labs rarely take the full 3 hours, and you get to do a creative final project! This class was my dream come true. If Marko Loncar teaches this course, then definitely take it in the future.",It was a fun and exciting way to explore concepts. It taught us to apply our knowledge through the labs. It also allowed us to further develop our teamwork skills through the unique and enjoyable final project.,"Fun projects, and it's easy to stay on top. Just don't procrastinate.",This course has very interesting labs and the final project is a blast to do. Lectures can be dull and the entire class is a tad disorganized.,"Only take this course if you want a fun elective or are considering concentrating in electrical engineering. If you are set on electrical engineering, take a more advanced course.","The project is a lot of work, but it's really a lot of fun!",It is a fun class. Teaches a lot. Don't expect much from the lectures though (unless the format is going to change) or the sections (almost non-existent). But the lab hours are awesome.,"This course taught me a great deal about electrical engineering, which is great. However, the lectures are sometimes confusing and many times not applicable to the psets. I feel that I could have learned the material better if the course were taught better. The final project is very cool though!","Take this course if you want to kill a GenEd but also learn something really cool. Everyone should take ES50; the stuff you learn here makes you more of a person, in the same way that reading Shakespeare does. Like with reading Shakespeare, ES50 is something you might not use one day but is such a key part of everyday life that everyone should take it.","""The more you don't know, the more you learn!"" Marko often said this, and I think it really was kind of the mantra/theme of the whole course. The teaching team was dedicated and readily available. The professors had a genuine enthusiasm for the material. Overall, the course was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. Wish more classes at Harvard were run this way. Highly recommend.","If you are at all interested in electrical engineering, I would recommend taking this course. The material is very manageable, the labs are fun, and the final project is very rewarding. The course is somewhat disorganized, but not to the point that it is a real detriment to the course.","If you don't plan on becoming an electrical engineer, do not take this class. It was a headache learning all of the different concepts that were breezed through in lecture. If you have a decent background with small circuits and want to take this course for the gen ed, go for it, otherwise, be prepared to work hard."
ENG-SCI 51: Computer-Aided Machine Design,cool class! It's all real. You apply what you learn,good class and should get better with time,"This is a really fun course. You will get to use a CNC milling machine, a laser cutter, learn how to cut and drill holes in metal, how to design things on a 3-D design software, and 3-D print some of your designs. At the end of the course, you get to design and build a robot with which you will compete with other teams. It was amazing seeing all the pieces of the course coming together in this final project. 

You do need to know some physics for this class, but it isn't something you can't easily pick up if you really haven't taken it before and have taken pre-calculus. I would ask the staff for a list of topics you should review before they apply these concepts in class so you know where people are getting the answers from.","I would say it can be a lot of fun, but it depends on how good/nice your team is and you will have to do a lot on your own. Can be a time drain.","I would stress to future students that this class provides a great introduction to the field of mechanical engineering and mechanical design, and provides a unique experience as it if often taken by students outside of the engineering concentrations.","I feel the goal of this course is the final project, which was a lot of fun (but a lot of work as well). This course also gives you a good overview of the aspects in engineering design.","Awesome class, you learn lots of important basic engineering things and get exposed to many machines. You also learn SolidWorks which is so useful, so make a point of learning it. The staff is amazing and its not incredibly time consuming.","It's a solid class--may not be the most exciting, but as far as intro engineering requirements go, it's pretty decent. Not too much work, very manageable, and easy to do well as long as you care. Not a bad gen ed either.","ES 51 is a great engineering course with excellent teaching staff and lots of hands-on lab work. The theory/lecture is well-taught and the teaching staff is available for office hours/willing to answer questions about problem sets and lab. You'll learn a lot in lab sections about how to operate the different machines in the undergraduate teaching labs and about designing parts/assemblies. Office hours are extremely helpful, and the undergraduate teaching lab staff is great.","You'll definitely have lots of fun in the labs, learning great skills like laser cutting, drilling, CNC milling, and 3D printing.  Lectures will be a tad boring at times, but these are essential for the exams.  Be warned, although it is an engineering course there is a significant amount of qualitative work since this is more of a design class, while the quantitative aspect is quite dumbed down (perhaps a bit too much) to basic algebra.  Daniela and Donal are great, I think it's mainly just the class that's still in the process of improving (for instance, this was the first year they did Turf Wars as the final project, so things will probably change in the future).  Also, although the projects are done in teams, be sure to contribute your fair share, since a decent portion of the grade is based on individual performance.  Overall, class was all right, not amazing but not too bad.","If you like making things or have an inclination towards math and science I recommend the class. The PSETs take a while, but the labs are basically arts and crafts that use math.",This class is a good introduction to mechanical engineering and a good way to make sure that you want to do mechanical engineering.,"ES51 is an amazing, hands on crash course on what it is like to be an engineer in the real world. If you are undecided and curious about mechanical engineering, let this course decide for you. You will either fall in love with the subject and develop necessary skills for the rest of your life, or you will realize it is not for you and had an amazing semester working with other brilliant people and have a good overall understanding of the design process. Crucial for innovators and people looking to develop skills to fabricate ideas into reality. Intimately integrated with the undergraduate teaching labs to create a comprehensive engineering design experience. Machine shop and lab after hours access a plus.","If you think you want to be a mechanical engineer, take this course, because by the end you'll know for sure either way","This class is incredible simply because of the final project. The class itself isn't the best right now, and it will likely be improved in the future, but the enormous amount of time I spent on the project was extremely enjoyable and very valuable.",The lectures and classes are not great but the design portion of the course is fun and interesting.,"Diffficulty: 3.5/5. It is a great class. A lot of work, but very worth it. Simple is the key in the final project.","ES51 is a very time consuming class, but also a very fun one.","ES51 is an excellent course for people who like to build things and have the math skills to handle in-depth calculations. I did poorly on the problem sets and exams because my math level simply wasn't where it needed to be, but I loved the final project and if you like to make things and mess around in the machine shop this class is worth a try.","This course is aimed to be equally aimed at mechanical engineering concentrators and Humanities students taking it as an elective; it does the latter too well to be good for the former.  For engineers, if you don't take it freshman year it's not a good use of your time except for the labs; for everyone else, it could be a fun course.  If you have any background in robotics, manufacturing, or college-level physics, I wouldn't recommend this course.","The final project is fun, but time consuming. Other than that you can get through pretty easily with the lecture slides and Psets, exams aren't too daunting."
ENG-SCI 52: The Joy of Electronics -  Part 1,"be prepared to spend ten hours per week in this class between lecture and lab.  You will only be looking at about 3 hours outside of it, but then a ton of time on the final project.  Avi and David are amazing especially as the semester goes on, and you learn more material.","If you are interested in electrical engineering at all, take this course.",Perfect EE breadth course for MEs.,This is a hands on class with a slightly significant work load. Take it if you're really interested in designing electronic circuits.,"I loved ES 52! I had taken ES 50 already, which is a nice overview, but it didn't really give me a strong foundation. I came out of ES 52 with much more confidence in my circuit-designing skills. The labs and project all build on knowledge taught earlier in the course, which helped reinforce the learning.","This was an amazing class!

It is a very large time commitment (8 hrs for lab/lecture plus time for readings and psets) but you get a lot out of it. As long as you put in a decent amount of effort and make sure you never fall behind by going to office hours and such you will learn so much! I was amazed by the projects everyone was able to create by the end especially considering that most of us had no prior circuit experience.

Avi and professor Abrams trade off teaching and are both really great lecturers. Also, both of them are always there for lab and have lots of office hours. During lab, Professor Abrams usually makes me feel like I am in massive amounts of trouble when I ask him questions so I'm a little afraid of him... But honestly he is very nice, just very blunt so try not to let it bother you. Avi is a lot kinder in how he approaches explanations and I always found it a lot easier to talk to him. Both of them are incredibly helpful, put a lot of work into the course and really want to see the students succeed.

My only warning would be cs. They say you don't need any coding background but you actually do. You will need to write some programs in arduino code which is basically C. I took CS50 concurrently and was fine.","If you're a mechanical engineer student trying to fulfill your electronics requirement, I'd recommend this one over Physics 123. I mean this one is pretty time extensive, but the difficulty is pretty fair. Things do get a little hectic around final project time, but it's manageable. In your schedule, this should go down as one of your harder classes.","Interesting course, but can be a big time commitment because of lab. Concepts can be difficult to grasp.","Really fun class, with a focus on the lab portion of the class. The staff really know their stuff, and are incredibly helpful with the labs, and especially the final project. I feel like I definitely learned a lot, but I might not have without already having taken ES50. I don't know how Physics 123 is, but for any EE's, it might be better to take that class instead, since it's supposed to cover more things in greater depth.","I don't think I've ever learned so much practical information in a single course. I went in with the attitude that electronics are magic, and came out with the attitude that I can take on a wide array of design challenges. I feel like I could invent some really cool things if struck with the ideas. Professor Abrams and Avi are extremely helpful if you just take the time to approach them. You may struggle at first (I definitely did), but know that if you put in a bit of effort you can get a lot out of this course.","Take this class if you really want to learn electronics, you need to like the material to enjoy the class. If you want a flashy class thats a fun gened and will give you an easy time take es50. If you like electricity though this class is amazing and will challenge you alot but also expand your knowledge and interest.","This class provides a great foundation for circuitry and electronics. It's very hands-on, and the labs, psets, and exams work well together to ensure that you learn the materials. Great course to take for any engineer."
ENG-SCI 53: Quantitative Physiology as a Basis for Bioengineering,This class is extremely difficult but required for the Biomedical Engineering concentration. Make sure to use your TFs as they will be the only way to get through this course.,"The class is poorly organized and appears to have been for years. It's a absolute shame that nobody has made an effort to structure this course effectively, and nobody seems to want to. Teaming up with peers and holding your breath tell it's over is the only way to get through.","The only reason you should take this class is as a Biomed requirement. It is so incredibly unorganized, unnecessarily difficult, and poorly taught that otherwise it is nowhere close to worth it. If you do have to take it, it's going to be rough for the first month or so, but then it gets easier for a while. Don't stress too much about the grade because it is a train wreck for everyone.","This class was incredibly interesting and I learned a great deal. It was also a lot of work when Maurice was teaching. We had both problem sets and labs every week, and the labs were often long, repetitive, and time consuming. The one advantage of this is that I got to know my lab partners very well. The problem sets could also be quite long and difficult. The class requires sharp problem solving skills and you really have to synthesize all of the information you have learned. I would be weary about taking this class with several other hard or time consuming classes, but I would definitely recommend it.",I mean you have to take it so take it. But get ready for some frustration.,"Unless you're interested in concentrating in biomedical engineering (whether or A.B. or S.B.), I highly won't suggest taking this course. Yeah, the material is interesting. Yeah, there are some interesting labs. But the level of disorganization just takes away too much from the course. Prof. Smith makes things too hard and moves too quickly; Prof. Bhatia teaches things a bit too slowly (though she does try to make sure we get her material very well). There really isn't a balance. Problem sets range from 50 to 200 points (and also difficulty levels vary too), so the imbalance can be very taxing. If the course had a bit more organization and better support, it would be an awesome course to take. But at this point, it's too disorientating and you come out feeling that all the time you put into it was to waste.",This is a difficult class and not very well organized. The material is interesting.,Do this only if you are seriously considering bioengineering--otherwise a lot of work.,"I kind of hated this class.  In the beginning of the semester, I would spend hours working on impossible problems on the psets--those kinds of problem where you read them and wonder if you ever even learned how to do that, since you have no idea where to begin.  On the first midterm I felt the same way, and so did everyone else since we all failed it.  I almost switched from BME because of this class.  However, after the first half, it really eased up and I was able to enjoy the material without stressing out so much about a heavy workload.  And, believe it or not, the material is actually incredibly interesting when you're not super frustrated by the psets.  My advice to future students is just to wait it out, since it does get easier.","This class, overall, is very difficult. It is a lot of MATlab at the beginning of the course, which can be intimidating. Be ready for Problem sets that will take a minimum of four hours a week to complete. Quizzes are difficult. The class definitely keeps you on your feet. With that said, the teaching staff and TFs really care and help as much as they can. Would definitely recommend, if you are interested in BME and can handle a heavy course load.","This class will be one of the most difficult classes you take, but will likely be worth it. The benefits of this class are that it introduces you to the fascinating quantitative side of physiology, which no other discipline can teach. Unlike many other physiology classes, there is no emphasis on memorization. Instead, the class emphasizes understanding of how systems work, and how dysfunction arises, which makes the material very interesting and exciting to learn. 

However, the complete lack of organization makes this class a battle, so be prepared. To get the most out of the class, it's best to start your work early and find a good pset group. Dr. Smith's psets are extremely challenging, particularly the first few ones, but don't let that discourage you. As long as you attend most of the TFs' office hours, its possible to get through the psets. Find a group of people to work with, and check answers with them, as this will make things a lot easier. Dr. Smith holds office hours, which can be helpful, especially for difficult problem sets (like the visual system pset) so go to office hours. Don't worry if the workload in the first few weeks seems overwhelming, you learn to adapt to it, and when Dr. Bhatia starts teaching, the workload drastically decreases. Understanding MATLAB is important for the labs and psets throughout the semester, so make sure you understand the tutorials assigned at the start of the course. 

Exams in this class can be extremely demoralizing, particularly Dr. Smith's questions, because they can be very challenging. It's important to go into the course recognizing that you wont get high 80 or low 90% on exams, but understanding that a lower score does not mean that you don't understand the material. Don't be discouraged by a low score on the first midterm, because Dr. Bhatia puts questions on the second midterm to make it easier. 

Overall, this course was challenging but extremely interesting. Being in office hours for multiple hours a week, you'll definitely make friends, and the BME community is very close. Don't be scared off by the high amount of work in the beginning, as you will learn to cope with it. Good luck!","If you are concentrating in Biomedical Engineering, you have to take this course, so... If you can, try to make sure that you have a strong background in CS, math, physics, chemistry, and biology before you take this class. It's difficult, but you'll learn so much from this class and you'll come out stronger and smarter! I've personally learned so much about myself from going through the experience of taking this class, and I've personally really enjoyed the material taught despite the challenges. Overall, I'm glad I took this class, even though it has been the most difficult class I've taken at Harvard.","This course is very time consuming and slightly disorganized, and it can be difficult to manage problem sets on top of laboratory reports.  However, the class support is great, and you quickly learn to work collaboratively with your peers.  The material that you learn is extremely exciting and useful, and Dr. Smith and Dr. Bhatia are excellent lecturers.  You will enjoy the class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it!","This course felt like a roller coaster ride. There were times when I was fully engaged in the material and felt comfortable with what we were doing in class and others where I couldn't tell you what we had done for the past three lectures. The fact that the course is split between two professors means that there is massive shift in the way the material is taught and tested when going from one to the other, but it doesn't necessarily have to be this way if the professors actually communicated with each other and with the class. The labs in this class were pretty interesting, but it often felt like they had only a little bit to do with the material in class.","The class' material is very interesting, but if you're looking to just explore medicine, this definitely isn't the class to take. The Psets and labs are very difficult and can feel tedious and painful-- definitely make use of as many office hour sessions as you can. The general disorganization makes getting a grasp on already hard subject matter even more trying.","This class is brutal. The MATLAB assignments will drive you crazy, the psets will occasionally drive you insane. A reasonable way to think of it s that you are taught the alphabet and expected to write a novel for homework. Your mind will be blown by the awesomeness of the content but be warned, if you don't enjoy anatomy/biology, stay away.","I can not express in words how horrible this class was. The professors were clearly intelligent and seemed to care about the material, but neither of them cared about the class. This is easily the most disorganized classes at Harvard and you should only take it if you need to concentrate in Bioengineering and if you have 20+ hours a week to do homework.","Not very well organized, but the material is very interesting! Go to the professors' office hours because they care a lot about you learning the material even if that sense does not come across in class.","If you take this course, be prepared for a somewhat disorganized class and a lot of work. Overall, however, the content you learn in this class is really really interesting and definitely worth all the trouble that this class may bring.","This class is a necessary evil as a biomedical engineering concentrator. Don't take it unless you're absolutely sure or pretty sure that BME is the concentration for you, but do not take the class with the idea that it's representative of the rest of the department or the rest of the experience as a BME concentrator. Be ready to hit the ground running the first few weeks, because the work is pretty front heavy in terms of psets and labs and learning how to make Matlab work. But on the bright side, everyone else who takes the class with you is also on the struggle bus, and your classmates become like a mini family",Go to help sessions/office hours.,"This was the most rewarding and interesting class that I took this semester, but go into it with some things in mind. The first half of the course will take over your entire life. I was consistently staying up until 2/3am at office hours to finish problem sets, and I was not procrastinating at all. People would start the problem sets the day we got them, attend office hours every time, and still be working on them the night before. They're hard. Do not wait to go to office hours, and do not wait to find friends in the class to study with. Both Maurice's and Sujata's office hours and helpful, so make an effort to attend both. The class is definitely frontloaded, so if you can make it through the first midterm, you can definitely handle the second half of the course. The class is plagued with disorganization and bad communication, so be prepared to be frustrated and to reach out to Maurice and Sujata when they've left you in the dark. Despite all of the flaws, the material is great, and you will truly feel like you're learning useful stuff. Even though some of the problem sets absolutely sucked in terms of workload and difficulty, I always turned it in feeling proud of what I'd learned and what I knew how to do. You will learn REALLY cool stuff.",Only take if required for your concentration. Very tough and demanding,"The material is interesting, but by the end I considered dropping BME. The teaching staff seems like they're trying, but the teaching itself is still lacking. Sujata focuses a lot on the content and Maurice focuses a lot on application, which is hard to get used to. Maurice mumbles a lot and Sujata is usually unavailable outside of class. The class in general.. really made me want to transfer to MIT.","This course is very intensive - the lab and homework components are extremely laborious. On a positive note, the subject matter is extremely interesting and you will be rewarded for all your hard work during the semester.","This course is hard, you will struggle, but if you stay with it you will be happy you did. The material is interesting and everyone becomes good friends with each other by the end of the year through the mutual struggle of doing psets and preparing for labs and tests. You learn so much, not just material but methods of studying and testing as well as new ways to think.",Some parts of the class are really unstructured,"It can be a pretty frustrating class at times, and it will consume your life at the beginning of the summer.  Nevertheless, it is super interesting material.",The class is very unorganized overall. Don't get discouraged by Maurice's psets and quiz. They're much harder than Sujata's and it is possible to do well in the course even it seems like it is too difficult.,It is a great introduction to the world of physiology and systems using mathematical models.
ENG-SCI 95r: Startup R & D,Paul Bottino is amazing. He has helped encourage so many students to pursur their entrepreneurial dreams.,"This is a great class. While it might not offer all of the concrete backing you might be looking for to help guide the creation of your startup, it will provide you with an environment to solidify your ideas and talk with like minded people. Overall this is a great class if you want to pursue a startup of any kind.",It is a great experience but only do this class if you are actually going to work on your start-up. Try to take step forwards and listen to the feedback from Mr. Bottino because it is very helpful.,Startup R&D is a great opportunity to work on a start-up and get great advice.,Take class if you need the extra time to work on a project,"Gave me the mental space to dedicate more time to my start up and make some real progress this semester.  I spent a huge number of hours a week working on ""this course"" but what that really means is that I was working on my start up. All the work for this class were things that I needed to be doing for my business anyway (e.g. putting together a pitch). It was also really exciting to be in a class with other students working on start ups who could relate to the thoughts/feelings/emotions I was going through.",This is a fantastic class if you have a startup idea and want to have a structured space and time to let it take off,"This course is a good for giving you time to work on a startup. You sacrifice 2 hours a week to useless activities in the classroom, but get to work on your startup otherwise.","If you are pursuing or wish to pursue a startup idea, this is a wonderful forum to do so.  Professor Bottino is a really awesome professor and he really cares about you and your startup.  For me, ES95 was a great class because I was already doing all the work needed for the class before taking it.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in pursuing their own idea.","If you have a startup, its nice that this course takes up an academic to work on it.",Bottino is amazing and will provide the guidance and advice you need when things are going smoothly or not quite so smoothly,"An easy class, yes, with absolutely no assignments. But an incredibly valuable one too.",If you are passionate about starting a company and very self driven then this is the perfect class for you.,"Awesome opportunity, but you have to really care about your idea. You'll get out what you put in. Work hard ~ at least ten hours a week, and you'll do well.","If you've got a startup that you're truly serious about working on, this is the class for you! You'll get excellent advice from both your peers and Mr. Bottino, and the class has pretty much no workload so you'll get extra time to work on your startup!","This is the best course I've ever taken at Harvard, hands-down and bar none. The fact that it exists is a testament to the excellence of Paul Bottino as an instructor and mentor, and every student with even the slightest inclination toward entrepreneurship should seriously consider joining Startup R&D. It's more than a class-- it's an unparalleled opportunity to do something incredible with your undergraduate education. If you're in doubt, go for it.","1.  If you want to work on a startup while at Harvard, take this course. 
2.  If you won't to have the most educational experience of your career, found a startup while at Harvard.
3.  If you followed 2, then refer to 1.","thought some of the meetings were not super productive and kind of a waste of time, but it was nice talking with other students who were facing similar problems with their ventures."
ENG-SCI 96: Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project,It is all about how your team works together so try to make it work well from the start,"How good this class is will entirely depend on the project and professor. Although in any case you can expect to be given a lot of last minute assignments, presumably to try and simulate a real-world consulting experience.","It's a really enjoyable class if you put your time and effort into it. The project is different each semester and for different sections, but generally it's a cool experience because you get to work on a giant team with all of your classmates on an interesting project that really challenges you to think in different ways than you are used to. There are no formal instructions nor will the professor tell you how to solve problems. You will get the chance to work on a real-world problem the way that people do it in industry. I would recommend it even if you are not an engineering SB concentrator because it's challenging in a fun way and you really bond with your classmates.","96 is a beast of a class, but if the topic is good, it can be very rewarding. Working on the SEAS move to Allston was particularly exciting for us to dive into. Be prepared to spend a tremendous amount of time particularly at the end during the presentation and report writing phase.","The final few weeks are extremely(!) busy, but ultimately it was a great course and you'll learn a lot about yourself and how to work on a large, undefined project.",I had an amazing experience in this class--the best group work experience I've ever had!,"Your team for this class will pretty much determine your overall experience with the course -- you will spend a ton of time with them, which can be really fun to make new friends, but definitely requires a lot of teamwork and compromising for the final product to be a success","ES96 will by far be one of the best courses you take at Harvard. Consider taking this even if it's not required for you! You get to spend a semester taking ownership of a real-world project and creating something you are proud of. Some of the people you work with are also incredible, and may even become some of your best friends! It is a lot of work, so don't take the class lightly. However, it is some of the most enjoyable and satisfying work you will find yourself doing at Harvard.","Find out which problems are being tackled by the ES96 sections your junior year, and try to pick one you find interesting. The class is great if you are invested in the project.","I assume that one's experience in this course depends wildly on the project and the professor.  Prof. Howe often sprung assignments on us (and lengthy or time-consuming ones at that), so I always had to have time set aside for ES 96 surprises.  His (stated) philosophy on the class was to dunk students into various activities, such as project planning or presenting, and then correct our mistakes after the fact, which I found more frustrating than productive, and wasted us a lot of time.  That being said, he clearly cares a lot about the class going well and tried to make himself available to students throughout the semester.","Be prepared to really engage with this course. You are bound to learn a lot of really essential skills about presenting and project management, but if you are excited about it you can also have a really positive experience getting to know your classmates.","Fun course but that will depend on topic (which changes each semester/section), prof, and group of students. All teamwork so having a good team makes or breaks the experience."
ENG-SCI 125: Mechanical Systems,"On of the best MechE classes. Katia is energetic and a good lecturer and is quite helpful outside of class too.  Lectures were so good I didn't even really need the book, just used my lecture notes for the pests.  Exams weren't easy but pretty fair and doable.",Extremely good course and very important for any mechanical engineer. Strongly suggest you take it even if you are in other forms of engineering.,If you're planning on taking this course it is most likely because you are required to. Be prepared for a class thats mostly math and not very much 'engineering.',"Concise, clear, straightforward teaching. Could easily have been much harder to learn this material. One of the stronger SEAS courses.

Course features a lot of spring-dashpot-mass and free body diagram type physics questions you're used to from AP physics. Material towards the end of the class becomes similar to what is taught in AM 105. The final group project is not too time consuming with a decent team, and there are no surprises in the psets. Lecture notes are acceptable as an occasional replacement for attending lecture if you're into that sort of thing.

Know MATLAB before taking this class. If you don't know MATLAB, be sure to be diligent about OHs and section and start early, otherwise you will not know how to do some problems  towards the middle/end of the semester.

Katia is a cool person and is very helpful and friendly. Recommended class.","Katia is a great lecturer, and the class is very well balanced. Basic concept eventually open doors to various other topics, of which Katia touches upon in the final month. Psets don't take more than 8 hours, and average probably 5 or 6. Labs this year are still uninteresting, but the final project is enjoyable.",Good class,Katia is awesome. One of the chillest professor I've ever had.,"Katia is a great professor. The class is fair, organized, and interesting. The material is pretty math-heavy, and the psets are sometimes pretty difficult, but if you make use of OH and section, you'll be fine.","The material is not that difficult, and lectures have a good format. However, the assignments were very long and tedious. They weren't that difficult, but single questions could take about 2 hours to get through. I feel like a lot of this class was teaching you to be a human calculator. Most of the time spent on problems was spent solving differential equations, not actually doing mechanical systems analysis. The labs were a nightmare. This year, we were randomly assigned to groups we had to work in the whole semester. It was so difficult to find a time we could all meet, and I feel like some of the frequencies we had to achieve were impossible. We just randomly guessed and checked values, and received no support from the teaching staff. Also, the final project was crap. We spent so much time building an egg-drop apparatus, only to be screwed over by a flaw in the scoring. The group that won ended up breaking their egg every single time, but they were rewarded for having such a light, short system. If you take this class, you should probably just tape a spring to the platform and then you will win for sure.",Very important class and the problems are fun.  Difficult tests and psets--allot a lot of time for the psets.,Start problem sets early.,"This course did a good job of teaching the material, especially reducing oscillating systems to simpler analogues and solving their equations of motion.  Although I thought it a generally weaker course than Physics 15b, I think that the overall teaching structure and strategy is good.","ES 125 was by far the best course I've taken in SEAS. Professor Bertoldi gave awesome lectures that were super useful, and she almost never asked questions on the PSets that were on material that she hadn't covered. The PSets were certainly tedious with really ugly, irrational numbers and definitely required you to use your head a bit, but they were a lot of fun to do and were never absurdly difficult. I feel that we learned some very powerful tools in this course, and it was one of the most important courses that I've taken for my Mechanical Engineering concentration so far. I'd love to take more classes with Katia, because this one was really great. Don't miss out on it!"
ENG-SCI 137: Energy within Environmental Constraints,"This class was very disorganized and there was not enough communication to know what was expected of you as a student.  Although it was the first year this course was offered, it was still much more disorganized than it should have been, and it is likely not to be any more organized next year.","This is an awesome course - incredibly interesting and pertinent! It was a little disorganized this year, but that's to be expected in the first year that a course is offered. I'm not an engineer and yet this course was totally fine for me.","Very useful practical knowledge regarding energy. Pretty easy as well, however regarding the research paper and final project it was quite unorganized and unlcear.",A valuable opportunity to explore the global energy system from a real world angle using data and information the is nearly impossible to come by anywhere else.,"I enjoyed this class. It was the first time it was being taught, and any time that happens there are obviously going to be some kinks. However, I thought the material was interesting, and I really enjoyed having Professor Keith as an instructor. He's very interesting and sometimes a bit all over the place, but he is also extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the course material. The structure of the course could be improved, and likely will be as the instructors get more used to working with undergrads. The class wasn't too hard or too much of a commitment, and I learned a bunch along the way. Overall, enjoyable class, not too painful, and you walk away with a better knowledge and understanding of the energy technology and systems in the world today. I also enjoyed learning the pieces of economics that fit into the engineering/energy/political decisions associated with climate change.","ES 137 was an interesting introduction to the energy industry today and the challenges it faces in improving efficiency and complying with environmental/climate standards. We covered most of the major sectors of energy (electricity generation, transportation), the environmental effects of energy production (pollution and climate change), and focused on cost-of-electricity calculations to determine what types of energy generation are economically feasible. If you're interested in the energy industry, this class is a good introduction.","This is a great overview of the current energy sector and the potential for renewables. It will give you a new perspective on things and will increase your overall 'energy savvy' ten-fold. Professor Keith is very impressive and can lead interesting and enlightening class discussion. However, he sometimes appears a bit too busy or arrogant to give students enough thought (for example, when you ask him a question, he will often cut you off halfway through with an answer). He is a great guy though, and is a good professor overall. There is not too much work - the quizzes and the final were fair and interesting. I'm totally happy I took this course!",Organization was not that great; we frequently found ourselves wondering what we'd be tested on.  Hopefully that will improve in future iterations.,"If the class is still like this, then no. Wait a couple of years, but under David Keith and the current teaching staff it is very disorganized. You may think not having psets is a blessing, but you really don't learn the material and it doesn't work out as well as you think it will.","If you want to better understand the energy language and be able to deduce valuations for cost of energy or electricity, take this course!","The lectures were awesome–Keith can easily hold your attention and the subject matter was both inherently interesting and presented in a compelling way, with a strong focus on real world connections, technologies, and applications.  The course was poorly organized, but that will be ironed out since this was the first time it's been taught.  The quizzes sometimes test stuff we didn't learn in lecture or quiz prep.","While it presented a very interesting perspective on the current concerns around energy, this class was poorly organized and assumed a great deal of knowledge about energy sources, thermodynamics, and basic economics. (But Carolann was fantastic, though I don't think she's returning as preceptor.)",The class was a bit disorganized but that it to be expected since it was the first year being offered. Professor Keith is great and also very enthusiastic about the material which makes lectures interesting. Overall course was great!,It's a renewable energy fanatic's wet dream.,"This class was very poorly organized, but as a first year course that is to be expected. The quizzes are far preferable to psets each week, especially considering that they dropped a bunch of them. Kieth is a great professor, he is clearly extremely knowledgeable, but sometimes I don't know how biased his facts are by opinion. If you are interested in renewables, this is definitely a good course to take.","One of the most practically focused classes that I have taken at Harvard.  If you are at all interested in the Energy sector then you should 100% take this class.  The workload is small, the value added is huge and the teaching is fantastic.  In the top 5 classes that I have taken in my three and a half years here.","I think this class will improve as it gets a little older. Because the class was new this year, I felt as if the staff did not have the entire course planned beforehand, which made things disorganized (like the website) or vague (like some of the assignments. If you're interested in the energy system, however, I would recommend it for the most part.I found Professor Keith's lectures to be informative, but not central to understanding the material; many of the problems on the quizzes were not related to lecture. Dr. Koleci was a great help, and I hope she continues to be part of the class in the future.",If you're interested at all in energy you should definitely take this class. It's a window into the brain of the professor and the guy is brilliant.
ENG-SCI 139: Innovation in Science and Engineering: Conference Course,"in its current form, this is the easiest class you will take.  However, if you want to work a little harder to learn a little more in an elective, they are out there.","If you want an introduction to entrepreneurship, especially within the sphere of biotechnology, this is the class to take. Great material and teaching staff that you can learn a lot from in and outside of the classroom.","This is an incredibly relaxed class that is also very stimulating, which is a great combination. You won't waste time doing meaningless problem sets or reading boring texts... the assignments and midterm and final projects are all great experiences.","This class is terribly organized but very minimal work. You are essentially expected to develop a business plan/pitch based on one of several technologies for your final project. There are infrequent weekly assignments and sign-up sheets used for attendance. It was not a stressful class, but I find that I did not come away from it with any tangible lessons learned about innovation. Would not recommend as a good class, but a pain-free one.",This class has very interesting material and a low workload.,Good startup class to better understand how innovation is thought about from an academic perspective,Its a interesting business school style class with little work requirements... take this class,"Worst class I have ever taken at Harvard. No structure, arbitrary grading, I basically didn't get anything out of this course.","This course is a great opportunity to learn about innovation and everything surrounding entrepreneurship: it offers a valuable glimpse of the conventions and practices in this particular ecosystem, and the final project will teach you a lot!","This class is a gem. It is interesting, with great professors and an almost non-existent workload. There are negatives, however. The class is disorganized, and you will not get adequate feedback on anything. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the class. One of my favorites at Harvard.",Doesn't have a heavy workload. Instructions for assignments are nonexistent. Class seems very disorganized because there are so many people teaching it. Learned something about entrepreneurship from Weitz and Boyce.,"Great, pain-free way to learn about entrepreneurship and venture capital!  Listen during lectures and try to incorporate those lessons into your midterm and final project.","139 Changed a lot this year, but the final project was on Biotechnology. I would recommend this to any student who is wants to learn skills in the intersection of business and technology. You learn tangible skills that will be useful to you.","you get to learn a bit about the process of innovation, you project will have to be biotech though be warned.","Although this class was easy, I got very little from it. The class was too big to have any meaningful case discussions, and the lectures were quite boring. The final project was interesting and fun, but we got very little help or instruction with it. Also, the teaching staff did very little in terms of feedback. Essentially, it was the situation where everything goes into a black box and out pops your grade. Still, for anyone who is interested in business or starting a company, this is a good introduction to this field, especially since there are very few business related courses taught at the college.","Its very helpful and interesting (and also easy) but also disorganized. Don't get frustrated by that, just roll with it, because its ultimately a satisfying course.","The class was inconsistent. Some parts were excellent, others were dry lectures. The course staff did not handle the huge course size well my year. Look to see if they've made improvements since then.","Not only does this class require relatively little work, but the work you actually have to do - developing a mock company and giving a full pitch on it in front of a VC panel - is really interesting and, depending on your career path, especially useful. Lectures are neat as well and some are pretty interactive, though be aware that they do take attendance (there's no section, though!). The only negative I'd say is that the class isn't well organized and clear guidelines for the assignments aren't really presented, which made the grading seem somewhat arbitrary and slightly harsher than one would expect. Still, this class is a perfect combination of useful, really cool, and not much work - I'd highly recommend.","The lectures and projects are great if you want to learn how to take an idea from inception to reality, how to build a pitch to give venture capitalists, etc.  Course organization was lacking, assignment expectations were often unclear.  Overall, however, I liked the course.","This class can be quite disorganized. Grading seems a bit arbitrary at times and classes are sometimes randomly cancelled (though that gives groups more time to work on their pitch). However, it's really nice to be able to apply what is learned in class to a project that's pitched in front of a panel of VCs at the end of the semester. I also enjoyed having multiple professors lecture, since they all come from various fields and have various expertise and insight. Also, you choose your own groups, so be sure to pick people you think you’ll work well with.",Grading is very unpredictable,Loosely structured innovation course with nice pitch at the end,"Grading is absolutely random and based off essentially two assignments. Don't take it as a GPA booster, only take it if you really are interested in learning about startups in the biotech space. Talk to John Boyce and go to lecture, every one is really cool.",This is class is a painless and very easy course to those who are interested in entrepreneurship biotech.,I'm not sure if it will increase your chances at success at being an entrepreneur but it was fun and made entrepreneurship seem more real as a a possiblity,Chill class,"You get a good overview of innovation and entrepreneurship for a Harvard class. You learn about startups, venture funding, and hear from live experiences. The class is very disorganized, the assignments are vague, and your grade is ambiguous throughout the whole course. The course is very easy with zero work. So take it as an easy elective.","It's a very easy course if you want an easy 4th class, take it.",NA,Amazing opportunity if you are into biotech and want to do a start-up. A bit lame sometimes. Ill-organized. Good grades for not too much effort.,It teaches about how to do a pitch. Everything other than that could be learned from somewhere like wikipedia.,This class was definitely the easiest course I have ever taken. It was honestly really fun and I learned quite a bit about innovation and entrepreneurship. Almost no weekly work and a very doable final presentation.,Lots of fun and still learn a whole lot!,Better organization would help improve the course.,"The course is quite disorganized and covers a range of topics at the surface. Some of the findings in innovation and quite straightforward and there is nothing in this class that was mind-blowingly different from what I expected. Final project helps you learn a lot, especially as they bring in real VCs, but because it is a group of 8, groupwork is a complete disaster.",Though the course sounded promising (real world experience pitching!  Working on tech the instructors actually wanted to spin out companies with!) it did not deliver.  It became instead an exercise in how to manufacture legitimacy by students who don't understand the technology.  I hope this is not what real biotech startups do :/,"If you end up in this course and it's larger than 20-30, it will be much more a lecture than a seminar/conference course. You will still learn a lot. If you ever want to use your technical knowledge in business or might consider a start-up, this course will provide a very good knowledge base and possible networking for future endeavors."
ENG-SCI 153: Laboratory Electronics,"Very fast-paced class with lots of material, some of which can be difficult. It's necessary to keep up with the readings because of the fast pace.
In terms of material, it is one of the most immediately practical classes I have taken. Covers both analog and digital electronics, which make up all of electronics. Extremely important for any experimental physicist and engineer.
It is one of those classes where you get out of it what you put in - labs aren't graded (except small participation grade) and there are no lab write-ups, but they help immensely with your understanding of the electronics. Plus, electronics debugging is a very useful skill.","Take this class. Tom is incredible. Be prepared to spend long hours in lab, but this is by far the best lab you've ever taken. Everyone does the labs not because they're required to, but because that's the only way to learn the material."
ENG-SCI 154: Electronic Devices and Circuits,Prof. Donhee is a nice person with great patience. This course is helpful with understanding the basic conformation of electronic device. Suits undergrad.,"I would only take this class if you have to for concentration requirement or if you really have the time and effort to put into the class. You really only take away as much time as you spend on it. The material can sometimes be a bit dry, you're learning about transistors after all. But it covers essential concepts for anyone that is seriously considering electrical engineering.",This course will really teach you about circuits and some of the details and intricacies involved with circuit components.  Any electrical engineer should definitely take thing course.,"Problem sets in the beginning do not take very long (6-8), but the later ones, (i.e. pset 6 onward) take a fair amount of time (15++). Professor Donhee does a great job building your understanding from the physical level to simple single transistor circuits with a few resistors to complex ones (oscillators, current mirrors, CMOS amplifiers). He is very knowledgeable, and expects a lot from his students. Don't ask questions he's already answered multiple times or whose answer is in the lecture notes",Take only if it's a required course or if you are reeeeeally keen on learning how transistors/amplifiers/diodes function at an atomic level.,"Prof. Ham is not teaching this course next year so everything will change. That being said, material is interesting if you're interested in electrical engineering. Even then, you would probably wish there was more application based material.","Well, it won't be taught by Donhee Ham anymore, so it will probably be totally different.  Take all of these evaluations with a grain of salt, because Donhee did things differently.",Professor Ham is a terrific teacher. Take this class if you want to get a solid understanding of some electronic circuits and devices.,"If it's taught the same way, be prepared to put a lot into the psets. Also make sure to ask questions if you don't understand anything. Donhee tends to ask ""Everyone got it?"" and then move on. Speak up if you aren't caught up, everyone else in the class will appreciate it.",You can learn a lot from Donhee and can see why he is so popular.,Work with people and go to office hours--this stuff is hard.,"It's a nice course in that you do learn a lot and don't have to have the stress of an exam or labs.  However, the psets can be tough so make sure to begin them as early as possible so that you can get help in office hours.",This class will give you a very thorough understanding of transistors. Professor Ham is brilliant and funny and very receptive to his students.,"Great class. The psets in the later half of the course are a bit challenging, but this class doesn't have exams so it evens out. Make sure you revise lecture notes. Prof.Ham is a genius and knows a lot about circuits. Also, don't EVER submit the pset late, as prof.Ham is very strict on the late hw policy (50% off)","Tough course, lots of very important material for EE's but I don't think I would take it if it wasn't a requirement for my concentration."
ENG-SCI 159: Introduction to Robotics
ENG-SCI 163: Pollution Control in Aquatic Ecosystems,"If Hannah is TFing again, be sure to be on-point with everything in your pset.","Patrick is fantastic. The course is very straightforward, but interesting and fun. It made me want to be an ecological engineer! If you are at all interested in environmental engineering, take the course!","If you're interested in what pollutants we're worried about, how they move in rivers and lakes, and how to treat them with large systems, this is a good course. However, due to the empirical nature of many of these topics, you'll feel like equations are being thrown left and right at you, especially once you're past the advection-diffusion material. This leads to some frustration with the work (i.e. worrying about small things like units, and plugging and chugging). The ends might justify the means if you enjoy designing (but not building) a more realistic treatment system. Patrick is also wonderful to work with and is very helpful at office hours.",Take only if you're interested in water management,"It's a pretty tough course, Patrick basically copies the textbook to the board and you have to write frantically to keep up, but I learned a lot and I came in not really caring about water pollution but by the time we did the final project I was pretty into it. Psets were really hard, I pretty much did an all nighter every week and still did really poorly on them, but when I realized that a) A lot of the problems are almost identical to example problems in the book and b) other kids did poorly on the psets, it felt a lot better. Overall good class, if you are choosing between this or Atmospheric or Soil Chem, I think this is your best bet."
ENG-SCI 164: Environmental Chemistry,Be prepared to decipher the textbook,"The material was very interesting, but the course is a little overwhelming if you don't have a strong chemistry background. The course requires a lot of work outside the class (I wasn't really able to finish a problem set without going to office hours). That being said, the teaching staff is very willing to help as long as you put in the extra time. Prof McKinney is a great teacher who wants everyone to understand the material.","Simply put, this is a terrible class. Despite having a 100-level number and a prerequisite, this class spends most of its time going very slowly over basic concepts. Even when you do learn new things, no attempt is made for students to gain insight into the fundamental concepts or develop physical intuition for the chemical processes. Instead, the focus is on formulaic approaches to calculating values to get answers to contrived problems. This class felt to me far like a dumbed-down high school class, despite the fact that it masquerades as a 100-level college class. 

This is without a doubt the worst class I have taken at Harvard, and the only one that I actively dislike going to. My classmates and I have literally been counting down the days of class left for the last few weeks of the semester.

Do not take this class.","It is interesting. The final project is awesome, you get to do a lot of cool things. Just stay on top of the work and go to section and you're good.","This class was a great way to learn chemistry.  It's relevant since it is focused on environmental chemistry, and it's well organize because it follows a [well-written] textbook.  I felt that the psets and midterms were very fair.  Karena really cares about the course, and takes the time to make videos of examples to help you learn the more calculative-side of the course.  This also makes it easy to review for the tests.  

Also, if Jordan is still the TF, he's the best!!  Jordan may be one of the few TFs I've had here that knows more than just what is on the psets, and is able to teach it well.","95% of the course covers chemical equilibria.  Honestly focuses on all of the meticulously derived, less exciting concepts of chemistry.  That being said it does fullfill a requirement, the labs are fairly painless, psets take between 6-10 hours, tests are difficult.","This is a great class. Karena, Jordan, and Caroline are all incredibly helpful and nice. You see the material on assignments, tests, and labs, so there's a lot of reinforcement. The environmental applications are fascinating.","AMAZING instructors, great material. This course is one of the most useful and interesting courses I have taken at Harvard. Definitely worth your time.","This class was extremely interesting and well taught. Karena is amazing and makes the class very enjoyable. It is a tough class with high level learning and hard psets. Although the labs and psets balance out nicely to only have one assignment a week. For the EPS people who are taking this as your only chem class, it will be tough, so ideally having some type of chem background or spending more time to learn the basics will help a lot. Still take this class over any other option:)",It's a course that will challenge you to think about chemistry in a very intuitive manner,"This class was definitely not easy, even if you had a very robust chemistry background. The lectures are easy to understand but the exams and the problem sets take a significant amount of time. Just know what you're getting into if this is a concentration credit and make your schedule accordingly. The project at the end is very manageable if you have a good group and a topic that interests you."
ENG-SCI 165: Water Engineering,"Chad is an awesome professor, and this course is good. The psets were a little annoying, but it's a fun course, and the final project is an awesome opportunity to really do something. The course gives students a lot of respect and freedom-- I felt we were treated like engineers, not like little undergraduate students.","This course was a joke. I came into it hoping it would be an interesting elective outside of my field of study, but it was not rigorous at all. This course only assumes high school level of chemistry and no environmental science background. If you have a decent mathematical background, then it will be very easy, as problem sets and midterm are just plug-and-chug problems with formulas easily found inside the book.
I guess if you're in environmental/water engineering, then you need to know the material, but it doesn't present enough material to warrant it as an interesting elective.
Final project was also very disorganized. There was absolutely no direction, so many projects were only marginally related to the class material and did not reinforce what was taught.",the p sets are SO hard.,The class is not too much work. There is only one midterm that wasn't too bad. Chad's t-shirt game is off the charts,"I think the material in this class is important, but the class is what you make of it.  The work does not require a lot from you, but since the class doesn't give you a very deep understanding of anything you really will gain the most by reading the textbook.  Otherwise, you'll probably do well in this class but you might feel like it's a waste.  

Also, think about final project topics well in advance!  If you have an exciting project, you'll really enjoy those hours spent in lab and have something cool to write up.","Pay attention and ask questions and this class will be very manageable. Chad is easygoing and approachable, and he makes an effort to avoid always lecturing the whole time, which makes it almost fun. Also nice to have an intimately sized course.","Great course. Much more in depth than ES 6, but similar material.",This class is good but it repeats a lot of things that are taught in ES 6 and almost any other ESE class. It was not a tough work load and the variable lab and homework helps keep each week with only one assignment. If you are looking to learn a variety of things and are ESE I would recommend taking a different class because this material is covers a lot in ES 6 and the level of difficulty is not that much more. It is interesting and not hard so if you just want to learn more about remediation take it.
ENG-SCI 176: Introduction to MicroElectroMechanical System,"This class is a pretty low workload and everything is done in groups which makes it much more enjoyable. Lectures can sometimes be a little disorganized, but overall the course provides a good understanding of MEMS and Microfluidic fabrication techniques.",gives a good introduction to the field of MEMS but not a class that will provide thorough knowledge. professors are great though and very open to discussions in and out of class.,"Interesting. Good alternative to googling all the information yourself, since not much original content was presented.",Course load is very manageable and the information learned is interesting and useful. Would be best taken with the intentions of working on a MEMs project outside of class.,"You get out what you put in - there is not a lot of mandatory work so it's a good course to balance your schedule. At the same time, this makes it more likely that you won't get as much out of the course as your busy schedule will probably keep you from putting in as much time as you would like. Lectures have too much material in them to absorb in a single two hour lecture. With that said, Habbal and Stark are experts and can answer just about any question you ask them.","This course provides a great overview of MEMS technology and its applications. The coursework is pretty straightforward, and this is a relaxed class overall.","Great, chill class for undergrads. More like a seminar, highly recommend to EE's to balance a heavy schedule."
ENG-SCI 181: Engineering Thermodynamics,Chances are you have to take this class - it's not easy but it is well structured which helps tremendously.,"Its a decent engineering course. Not as exciting as some courses, but the material is interesting enough. It is more targeted towards mechanical engineering, which was a little frustrating at times for a biomedical engineer, but i still felt like i learned a lot",Only and I repeat only take it if you absolutely have to. Probably one of the hardest classes at Harvard. In many situations even the tf's did not know what was going on and struggled to help the students.,Find yourself a good study buddy. You're going to need them.,"If you are a physics student, this class is a much easier alternative to Physics 181. You will still learn all of the material necessary for the GRE and, unless statistical mechanics is necessary for the field you're going into, you'll probably leave with more applicable knowledge from this course. Aziz is a much clearer lecturer than most physics professors.","go to sections and office hours - they are immensely helpful if the TFs are nearly as helpful as they were this year. course is frustrating and time consuming, but i defintiely gained a knowledge of thermodynamics.  wish material on HE 2 was covered longer and perhaps less topics were covered.",It will be hard and time consuming but worth it.,Go to office hours. And section even though it's optional.,Really interesting but difficult material.,"Much like what people have said for eons about this class, it's a great class and you learn a lot but it will take a huge amount of time. The course is extremely well organized, in my opinion. Do capitalize on Aziz's availability (OHs and class time), he understands the material really well and he is more than happy to explain things if you only ask.","You will learn a huge amount, but it takes a lot of time--be prepared to work hard and go to office hours when you can.","Great engineering class. Material is fun and problem sets contain realistic industrial problems about energy generation, engine operations, and electrochemistry. Great teaching staff. Concepts and calculations are always related back to industrial applications. Lectures are engaging and interesting; sections and office hours helpful in completing problem sets. Labs are interesting.","You have to take the course, so set your jaw and deal with it. I would be shocked if you enjoyed it, but at least you bond with other engineers over your shared misery.","This course is a requirement for engineering, but the material is actually quite useful.  While it does require a significant amount of outside work (between psets, readings, studying for reading quizzes,labs, lab write-ups, etc.), if you put in the effort, it really isn't that bad.  Definitely make use of sections and office hours!",ES181 is vital to a good engineering background. Challenging but rewarding course.,"if you don't have to take it, please don't. Possibly my hardest class yet but I can't forsee how much easier it could possibly be",Usually the only people taking the class are people who need it for requirements.  I definitely learned a lot in this class and it wasn't nearly as bad as what I heard.  Psets would take an average of like 8 hours which really wasn't bad.  Some people would start it at office hours the day or day before it was due.,"This class is hard and time consuming but not as bad as I'd been led to believe going in. Start the problem sets early , GO TO OFFICE HOURS, do lots of practice problems in preparation for exams, and you'll get through it in one piece.","The concepts are not really that hard, but putting them to use is often difficult and unwieldly.  The class is not very interesting but is well taught.  As far as workload, the entirety of my thursday afternoon/night each week was sacrificed, but other than that it wasn't too bad.  It's a fairly tough course, but nothing you can't handle.","Get ready to devote ridiculous hours to this class. Just to keep up, you have to spend about 12 hours for each pset and 3 hours for the weekly reading. The good news is that the class is taught well, and there are countless resources to help you.","This was actually one of my favorite classes. The material is hard, but it is taught incredibly well. There are a lot of resources to help you understand the material. If you're up for working hard, this will be a very rewarding class","This class will be the most challenging class you take at Harvard, but the supportive staff and professor make it all worth it. You can and will be able to master the material, and you will feel amazing when you do. This is the type of class which is so challenging students in the class form a type of bond that makes it feel close and fun.",You have to take it.,"Be thankful that Aziz is not teaching the course next year.
Enough said.",Incredibly difficult material presented just about as well as it can be.,"You're probably only looking into this course because it's a requirement, so you'll most likely take it regardless of what I say. Anyway, the class isn't as awful as it sounds, but it's still a pretty big pain! Just be sure to actually engage yourself with the reading, as that's where you'll learn most of what you know in the course. It's easy to just skim through and not actually absorb anything, but don't do that! Also, try to start your psets early and study for midterms using the practice problems provided. If you do all of those things, you should be pretty set in the course, and should be able to learn a decent amount!","You better strap yourself down to whatever chair you're sitting on, because this is going to be a rough f**king ride."
ENG-SCI 190: Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering,Worst class I've taken.,"The iteration of this class with Prof. Spaepen was really hard--much harder than in previous years.  However, it was also really rewarding.  The book of lecture slides is what we were tested on on the final, so it's really helpful to know everything in it.",If Spaepen is teaching this class DO NOT TAKE IT. Create a scheduling conflict and try to take it at MIT. This is literally the worst class I have ever taken at Harvard.,"This is definitely the most difficult class I've taken at Harvard, and I've taken a number of difficult ones. It's difficult both in terms of conceptual understanding and workload. Imagine surveying the whole field of chemistry and the whole field of physics in one course. Not just intro chemistry and intro physics. The whole field; both fields. That's ES190. There is very little guidance on how to psets because lecture doesn't actually cover any examples. Everyone is thrown into the deep end on this one. Don't take this course. To put my recommendation in perspective: I've now taken 28 courses, and I would recommend against only 3 total. This is one of them. Don't take this. You've been warned.","Only took this course as it was a requirement.  The pace was unreasonable for undergrads.  Spaepen definitely knows the material, but he needs to do a much better job in decreasing the speed in which he goes through the notes.  
The handwriting in the notes is also not that easy to decipher.
The TFs weren't too helpful at first, but improved later on.
Spaepen can be extremely condescending, especially during office hours or even during class when you ask him a question that he believes you should know as a ""mechanical engineer"" student.   Psets were brutal since we never had been given an example problems to use for  the concepts that he covered in class.
He also believes a lot in having students memorize derivations, and I don't think that that is practical for the real world when you can look up most of these formulas.","I want to be nice because Spaepen tries, he really tries.  But he was so disconnected from reality that learning anything was a challenge. He seems shocked whenever we don't know something about materials science, teaching everything in the class as though we already know it.  The basic strategy of teaching where you develop a strong foundation in the basics before moving onto advanced concepts seems to be totally lost.  The class notes are unreadable and as hard to follow as the lectures.  I was not taught materials science.  I taught myself.  This class can in no way take credit for my learning.  I learned in spite of it.","This is the hardest class I have ever taken (and I've already survived a lot of engineering classes). The course moved so fast, and we basically covered 3 MIT courses worth of material. I wish I had secretary experience, because maybe then I would have been able to read the messy cursive handwriting of the professor that filled 300+ pages of a handwritten ""book."" That thing gave me a headache. Take this class if you want to spend 30 hours a week drowning in the darkness of ignorance and enduring repeated emotional and mental despair. Also, if I had a penny for every time the professor said, ""You already know this, so I'll skip it,"" then I would be a millionaire. Unfortunately, I didn't know any of the things he skipped, and I never learned them either.","Overall, this class was a very negative experience, which felt like drinking through a fire hose. The material is difficult, and little effort were made to actually explain concepts clearly. Students were not given that much support on homework and class materials in general. Do not take if it is not required of you to take.","The material is very difficult to understand, but the actual workload is quite reasonable.  The more time you spend reading over the notes and working through the concepts until you could explain them yourself, the better you will do on the tests.  Your percentage grades will be low, but difficult problems create great learning opportunities."
ENG-SCI 220: Fluid Dynamics,"This is a good introduction to many concepts in fluid dynamics, but I honestly don't think it will end up helping much with my future endeavors. I would only recommend it if you have a very strong math background and strong interest in the topics.",Important to be self-disciplined because no graded psets! Good to find a study group or partner to go over pset answers. Topics sometimes seem scattered and it takes awhile for it to come together. The exams tend to be a fair bit more straightforward,"You get as much out of the class as you put in. If you don't do the readings or the homework you are likely to walk away without much understanding, but if you put in the time you can learn a lot.","Great selection of topics, imho. Prof Rice has a wonderful personality, which makes the course casual and enjoyable.","It is applicable to other areas of physics, but hard to find another class like this where it is all in one place.",Need to put a lot of time reading book and solving problems for each week's problem discussion.
ENG-SCI 222: Advanced Cellular Engineering,"This class give you a nice opportunity to read up on papers that are more oriented towards designing biological systems than solely trying to understand the ones that already exit. If you have already taken molecular and cell biology the material isn't really challenging, but it's interesting. The final project is fun and allow you to put some of the idea presented in lecture towards your own desired application. There were no exams, which was a plus.","This is a good class to take if you are interested in pursuing any field in bioengineering because you will learn fundamentals of cellular behavior that will help with most fields (tissue eng, biomaterials, drug delivery).","interesting class, cutting edge-content, moderate workload, and Joshi is a reasonable person and good teacher; would have been nice to focus more on genome editing or to incorporate that into the lab",It course may not be suitable for beginner in cellular engineering as the professor assumes a solid background for all enrollee.,Learned a lot from writing the problem sets by doing research on your own.,Take this class if you have ever had an interest in cellular engineering.,Good overview of topics related to cellular engineering. Helps you formulate a research direction for your PhD
ENG-SCI 239: Advanced Innovation in Science and Engineering: Conference Course,One of the best classes at Harvard.
ENG-SCI 240: Solid Mechanics,"Professor Vlassak is great!  Challenging class, but you will learn a ton.  Also, Yecheng was an awesome and helpful TF!",I wish I had bought or borrowed a copy of the Timoshenko book that was on reserve in the library.  I did visit the library read it a couple times but might have benefitted from easier access and thus more time spent reading it.,"Professor Vlassak is an amazing lecturer, and you will really learn the fundamentals of solid mechanics. If you don't have much background, learning the material and doing the problem sets will require a lot of time.","This is a very traditional course in solid mechanics, but it totally nails it. Joost is a great lecturer, and is always happy to stay after class and discuss whatever is on your mind. The lecture notes are comprehensive and very helpful. Assignments are occasionally long but are very fair and reinforce the lecture content. This course is a must for anyone considering studying mechanical engineering."
ENG-SCI 246: Plasticity,Best Professor I have ever had. Really enthusiastic and knowledgeable.,"This class, including the materials, assignments, and everything, is a very difficult.  However, Professor Suo is a great lecturer, and I would highly recommend that anyone considering taking this class should definitely take it.  You will learn a lot from this course, and professor does a great job of giving a comprehensive view as opposed to just looking at plasticity.","It is a very fun course! Professor teaches in a very simple and enlightening way by illustrating many interesting examples, not only lengthy calculations. I think you can learn a lot about plasticity as well as topics in rheology in this class."
ENG-SCI 250: Information Theory,"This subject, in some sense, is one of the most fundamental of them all. If you are fascinated about the purely mathematical limits of communication (beyond physical), this is it."
ENG-SCI 256: Informal Robotics / New paradigms for Design and Construction,"There's a lot of pressure to progress week to week, but you come out of this class having built something awesome. Also the exposure to different aspects of robotics and design is very interesting."
ENG-SCI 259: Advanced Introduction to Robotics,"Learned a lot, but it's a busy class. Lab and HW alternate weeks.","The class was interesting, but focused entirely on robot arms instead of mobile robots. Very challenging amount of linear algebra and geometry.",The course is pretty comprehensive but taught in a digestible manner.
ENG-SCI 268: Chemical Kinetics,"It's a pretty small class (N = 4), so get ready to be 25% of the discussion."
ENG-SCI 274: Quantum Devices,"You learn as much as you put it. Professor is a very intellect one, give you physics pictures instead of math equations."
ENG-SCI 276: Introduction to MicroElectroMechanical System,This is a great class! A lot of what I learned will be applicable to my research.
ENG-SCI 289: Innovation and National Security,"This was a very interesting class. The subject matter is unique, and the experience of collaborating with students from very different fields was enriching. I would recommend it to students with initiative and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone into a new reference frame. The assignments are done as large groups, so be willing to work hard, support your teammates, and think outside the box.","my reservations being, don't expect it to be a course you ""take""... this is one you ""do."" So... if you're looking for a course to sit back and listen, maybe write a paper or whatever, this one's not for you."

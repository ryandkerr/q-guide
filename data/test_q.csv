APCOMP 209: Data Science,"Good to work on, important to learn","This is a very ""practical"" class. After taking this class, you will learn how to actually work with data and do statistics and machine learning properly. After taking this class and working through the psets, I feel prepared to do any kind of data science job, so definitely take this class if you're interested in something like that. I also recommend people from other concentrations, like biology or social sciences, to check this class out because you will likely be working with data in your research, and this class can really teach you how to get it done. That being said, the class wasn't very organized this year. The lectures were insipid and not very interesting, and the professor was not very good at explaining things mathematically. He was hand-wavy at times. Additionally, the course suffered some lack of communication with the students and posted poorly worded problem sets, requiring lots of Piazza posts to clarify. 

As for difficulty: The more experience you have with programming (especially Python) and statistics, the easier this class will be. The psets are bi-weekly and take around 6-8 hours to finish. I would definitely recommend going into this class with some experience because there is a lot of coding involved. Otherwise you will literally have to Google everything and the first few psets will be tough, but in the end you will get the hang of it and you will have learned a lot. 

This class can inspire you to keep doing data analysis and find some very cool patterns if you extend its lessons to your own research. I would recommend, but be aware of poor execution by the teaching staff.",Long homework's with some good lectures.,"to the extent that assignments are carefully written, this course will be fun and you'll learn some interesting stuff",Lecture is boring but we learn a lot from homework.,"Much of the learning is done outside of lectures. Read the python analysis book, it will help you save time when attempting problem sets.","It's a good high-level overview of data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.  None of the topics are covered in great depth.",Great class on the general data science process,"This was a pretty interesting course. Lectures were very relaxed and interesting while problem sets went significantly more in depth into coding and thus were quite different from what was covered in lecture--I quite liked this; others didn't. As long as you're willing to figure things out on your own, you don't need very much programming experience coming in (I had just taken CS50, and even that much wasn't necessary). By the end of the course, you will have a pretty good grasp of data wrangling in Python (and the pandas library in particular). You work through interesting examples like baseball or election statistics; problem sets this year did get a bit repetitive and unnecessarily long by the end of the semester, and there were a lot of complaints about this. The instructors are really great though and really care about the material. I'm really glad I took this course--it wasn't too much work, and I feel like I got a pretty solid introduction to data science. The final project was fun too.","Take your time with the assignments. Getting used to work with data requires some muscle learning as well, but once you got it, you got it!",The homework and project is likely what data scientists doing in their work.,"The subject of the course is incredible and there is a lot of important and interesting material to learn. That being said, the staff was highly disorganized this year, and homework assignments were full of errors.","This class is a good introduction to machine learning and big data analysis. Be prepared to spend lots of time learning python, pandas, sklearn, and few other python modules if don't already know them. Don't expect to learn the theory behind machine learning. Having a good handle on basic statistics will go a long way.","It is a pretty broad introduction to data science, and good conceptual overview of many different types of analysis (such as PCA, random forests, support vector machines, etc).","This course covers broad topics, but it offers very little depth.","This was only the second year the course had been taught and the first time it had been taught with this staff. The identity of this course is still being defined, and the experience will depend largely on who is teaching/organizing the course. The problem sets were more difficult than necessary simply because the instructions were unclear. In fact, the most efficient approach to doing the homework was to wait a few days until the early starters worked through the problem set and asked questions on Piazza to clarify the confusing parts; this is clearly unfair. Most of the value of this course comes from doing the homework. The lecture material seemed unorganized and was not taught well. All that being said, this course has a lot of potential, and I do feel comfortable working on data analysis in Python now.",Self-guided learning and an ability to solve programming challenges independently serve students well in this course. That mirrors much of real-world data science practice but will not benefit students in need of more hands-on academic guidance.,Data scientist required.,This course is too superficial for you to come away with anything. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
